										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1943, on the Russian front, decorated leader Rolf Steiner (James Coburn) is promoted to Sergeant after another successful mission. Meanwhile, upper-class and arrogant Prussian Captain Hauptmann Stransky (Maximilian Schell) is assigned as the new commander of his squad. After a bloody battle of Steiner&#8217;s squad against the Russian troops led by the brave Lieutenant Meyer (Igor Galo), who dies in combat, the coward Stransky claims that he led his squad against the Russian and requests to be awarded the Iron Cross to satisfy his personal ambition together with that of his aristocratic family. Stransky gives the names of Steiner and of the homosexual Lieutenant Triebig (Roger Fritz) as witnesses of his accomplishment, but Steiner, who has problems with the chain of command in the Army, and with the arrogance of Stransky, refuses to participate in the fraud. When Colonel Brandt (James Mason) gives the order to leave the position in the front, Stransky does not retransmit the order</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Longing for freedom, a lowly, hapless Outer Circle bureaucrat of the Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith, summons up the courage to write down his unspoken desires in his little secret diary, in itself an illegal act. Serving silently at the pleasure of the grim, autocratic hyper-state of Oceania, Smith knows the INGSOC (English Socialist Party)&#8217;s supreme leader, the omnipotent Big Brother, watches his every move. As the permanent totalitarian government tightens its suffocating stranglehold more and more, Smith meets Julia, another rebel, and a dangerous clandestine affair begins. There&#8217;s no turning back. Sooner or later, the illicit couple will have to pay as sex is meant for procreation only, and deriving pleasure from it is also a crime, an intimate one often reported by one of the participants to the terrifying Thought Police. What makes a good citizen?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first-class compartment of the December 1935 departure of the Orient Express from Istanbul is full, unusual for this time of the year. Regardless, the famed and fastidious Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who needs to get back to London immediately, is able to secure a last-minute passage in the compartment with the assistance of his friend, Signor Bianchi, one of the directors of the train line who is also making the trip. Some of the first-class passengers seem concerned about Poirot&#8217;s presence on the train. At least one of them has reason to be concerned, as later, another first-class passenger, who earlier in the trip asked Poirot to provide protection for him due to several death threats, is found murdered in his stateroom by multiple stabbings. At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to</p>
