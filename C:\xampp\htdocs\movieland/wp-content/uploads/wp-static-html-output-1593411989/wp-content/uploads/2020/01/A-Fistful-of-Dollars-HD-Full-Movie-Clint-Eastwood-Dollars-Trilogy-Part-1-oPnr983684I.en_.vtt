00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:35.371
You? You again! Get out!

00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:40.877
Do what I told you.
Get out!

00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:51.554
Go on! Run! I'll teach you
to keep away from me!

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:54.015
Run!

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.940
Papa!

00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:06.402
You filthy dog!

00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:08.738
You'll settle with me!

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:32.554
Let's go.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.507
Welcome to you, stranger.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.760
My name is Juan de Dios.
I am the bell ringer.

00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:39.055
Why are you here?
To see the Rojos?

00:06:40.223 --> 00:06:42.850
No, not the Rojos.
Is it the Baxters, maybe?

00:06:42.934 --> 00:06:44.644
No, maybe not
even the Baxters.

00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:47.730
You want to get rich? Well, for that
you have come to the right place,

00:06:47.814 --> 00:06:49.774
if you use your head.

00:06:49.857 --> 00:06:53.569
That's because everybody here
has become very rich,

00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:55.321
or else they are dead.

00:06:55.405 --> 00:06:59.033
What you want to buy?
Some guns? Liquor?

00:06:59.617 --> 00:07:02.704
You don't buy. You sell.
You sell lead in exchange for gold.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.957
You will get rich here,
or you'll be killed.

00:07:06.332 --> 00:07:08.376
Juan de Dios tolls the bell
once again.

00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:30.440
It's not smart to go
wandering so far from home.

00:07:32.942 --> 00:07:35.028
I reckon he picked
the wrong trail.

00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:37.155
Or he could have
picked the wrong town.

00:07:37.238 --> 00:07:39.782
His big mistake, I think,
was getting born.

00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:43.453
If you want any work,
looking like that

00:07:43.953 --> 00:07:45.872
you could try
being a scarecrow.

00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:50.126
Oh, no, the crows are
liable to scare him, maybe.

00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:09.312
Hello.

00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:22.075
You can't get rich like that.

00:08:22.158 --> 00:08:25.578
At most, you will only
succeed in being killed.

00:08:29.082 --> 00:08:31.584
With all of the trouble we
have, all we needed was you.

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:32.835
What are you
looking for?

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.254
Food and
something to drink.

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:36.464
Water's over there.

00:08:36.547 --> 00:08:38.591
No, no water.

00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:40.635
Eating and drinking
and killing.

00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:44.347
That's all you can do, just
like the rest of your kind.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.601
By the way, you'll
have to mark this up.

00:08:48.684 --> 00:08:53.481
I know. You have no money.
After all, you just got into town.

00:08:53.564 --> 00:08:55.775
But if you don't mind
doing a little killing,

00:08:55.858 --> 00:08:59.779
you will have no trouble finding
someone eager to pay you.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.326
Hmm.

00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:08.871
My roulette wheel.
That, too, was bartered.

00:09:09.956 --> 00:09:12.125
No one ever comes here
to play.

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:15.128
We spend our time here between
funerals and burials.

00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:17.755
Yeah. Never saw a town
as dead as this one.

00:09:22.135 --> 00:09:24.262
You will never see
another like it.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.972
What's wrong
with the place?

00:09:26.055 --> 00:09:28.057
We've had
too many killings.

00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:30.143
You have seen the women?

00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:32.228
None of them are women.
They're widows.

00:09:32.353 --> 00:09:34.272
The place
has only widows.

00:09:34.355 --> 00:09:36.816
Here you can only gain respect
by killing other men.

00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:38.901
So nobody works any more.

00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:44.031
Seems somebody doesn't
share your opinion.

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:45.575
Yes.

00:09:54.917 --> 00:09:57.420
Know why Piripero
looked you over?

00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:59.463
To take
your measurements.

00:09:59.547 --> 00:10:01.841
He is so experienced he
can do it with a glance.

00:10:01.924 --> 00:10:03.843
You will be a customer.

00:10:05.136 --> 00:10:06.846
Don't laugh.
I'm not joking.

00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:10.683
I want to warn you that those murderers
will make a corpse out of you one day.

00:10:10.766 --> 00:10:13.352
That's why I want you
to get out of here.

00:10:13.436 --> 00:10:16.439
You don't want to stay
in this cemetery.

00:10:16.522 --> 00:10:18.608
Finish up and get out.

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:23.613
I told you
I can't pay you.

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:25.656
Be my guest,

00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:28.743
but get out of San Miguel,
will you?

00:10:31.037 --> 00:10:32.997
Where does that lead?

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.832
The balcony.

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:39.795
Why are you
going there? Hey.

00:10:40.796 --> 00:10:42.131
To have a look.

00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:44.550
Things always look
different from higher up.

00:10:44.634 --> 00:10:46.385
But nothing's up there.

00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:47.762
Go ahead and get out!

00:10:56.896 --> 00:10:58.689
Who are they?

00:10:59.106 --> 00:11:02.485
Bandits.
Bandits and smugglers.

00:11:02.985 --> 00:11:04.570
They come down from Texas.

00:11:04.654 --> 00:11:07.657
They cross the frontier to
stock up on guns and liquor.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.659
The cost is
much less here.

00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:13.537
Then they go back and sell the
guns and liquor to the Indians.

00:11:14.914 --> 00:11:17.667
Any town that sells guns and
liquor has gotta be a rich one.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.836
Not the town, only those
who buy and sell,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.631
and the bosses are the
ones who clean up.

00:11:23.714 --> 00:11:27.093
Yeah? Somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.

00:11:27.176 --> 00:11:29.720
That's true, but when
there are two around,

00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:32.306
then I'd say that
there is one too many.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.642
Two bosses?

00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:36.644
Very interesting.

00:11:36.727 --> 00:11:39.105
Interesting is right.

00:11:39.188 --> 00:11:41.732
The Rojos boys, three
brothers who sell liquor.

00:11:41.816 --> 00:11:45.903
And then there's the Baxters,
big gun merchants.

00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:51.117
If I'm not mistaken, you already
met Baxter's gang, didn't you?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.868
Yeah, we met.

00:11:52.952 --> 00:11:57.206
But you're lucky. They don't usually
limit their fire to the mule.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.293
A man leaves his own land and
looks around for any reason,

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:04.463
Juan de Dios tolls the bell and
Piripero sells another coffin.

00:12:04.547 --> 00:12:06.007
Two bosses.

00:12:08.551 --> 00:12:12.930
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs
around both sides of the frontier,

00:12:13.014 --> 00:12:15.141
and they pay in dollars.

00:12:17.852 --> 00:12:20.021
The Baxters over there.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.523
The Rojos there.

00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:25.026
Me right in the middle.

00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:27.111
Where you do what?

00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:30.740
Crazy bell ringer
was right.

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:33.326
There's money to be made
in a place like this.

00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:37.913
If you're thinking what I suspect,
I tell you, don't try it.

00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:41.459
Which one of the two
is the stronger?

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:44.503
Which one of them
is stronger?

00:12:44.587 --> 00:12:48.007
Well, the Rojos,
especially Ramon.

00:12:59.352 --> 00:13:03.105
Don Miguel Rojo,
I want to talk to you.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.902
Don Miguel, I hear
you're hiring on men.

00:13:08.444 --> 00:13:11.197
Well, I might
just be available.

00:13:12.615 --> 00:13:15.701
I gotta tell you
before you hire me,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.456
I don't work cheap.

00:13:35.888 --> 00:13:37.807
Get three coffins ready.

00:14:05.751 --> 00:14:08.129
Listen, stranger.
Didn't you get the idea?

00:14:08.212 --> 00:14:10.589
We don't like to see bad
boys like you in town.

00:14:10.673 --> 00:14:12.258
Go get your mule.

00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:15.761
You let him get away from you?

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:18.597
That's what I want to
talk to you about.

00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:21.767
He's feeling real bad.

00:14:22.017 --> 00:14:23.561
My mule.

00:14:23.644 --> 00:14:27.481
You see, he got all riled up when you
men fired those shots at his feet.

00:14:29.692 --> 00:14:32.862
Hey, are you making
some kind of joke?

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:34.321
Mmm-mmm. No.

00:14:35.322 --> 00:14:37.825
See, I understand you men
were just playing around.

00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:40.578
But the mule...
He just doesn't get it.

00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:42.872
Of course, if you were
to all apologize...

00:14:55.217 --> 00:14:57.136
I don't think it's nice,
you laughing.

00:15:01.182 --> 00:15:04.518
You see, my mule
don't like people laughing.

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:08.272
He gets the crazy idea
you're laughing at him.

00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:11.025
Now, if you apologize,
like I know you're going to,

00:15:11.942 --> 00:15:15.404
I might convince him that
you really didn't mean it.

00:15:43.933 --> 00:15:46.310
I saw the whole thing.
You killed all four of them.

00:15:48.103 --> 00:15:50.773
You'll pay all right.
You'll be strung up.

00:15:53.067 --> 00:15:54.443
Who are you?

00:15:54.902 --> 00:15:57.196
Don't fire a shot.

00:15:58.197 --> 00:16:01.367
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.

00:16:03.077 --> 00:16:07.790
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff, you
better get these men underground.

00:16:21.136 --> 00:16:23.639
My mistake. Four coffins.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.742
I told you I wasn't cheap,

00:16:43.826 --> 00:16:46.203
but I think you'll find
it's worth your while.

00:16:46.287 --> 00:16:48.998
...97,98,99, 100.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.585
The rest
when you're all done.

00:16:52.668 --> 00:16:54.837
When do I start?

00:16:55.212 --> 00:16:57.923
I'm not in a hurry,
at least for the moment.

00:16:58.132 --> 00:16:59.675
I'd say with
four less Baxters,

00:16:59.758 --> 00:17:02.261
right now is as good a
time to start as any.

00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:06.432
In a few days I hear there will be a troop
of cavalry passing through San Miguel.

00:17:06.515 --> 00:17:10.894
I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

00:17:11.979 --> 00:17:14.064
You seem to be
well-informed.

00:17:15.816 --> 00:17:20.863
In these parts, a man's life often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

00:17:22.072 --> 00:17:25.117
This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

00:17:27.536 --> 00:17:31.790
My brother Ramon did that.
He often uses it for target practice.

00:17:31.874 --> 00:17:35.919
With a gun in his hand,
no one stands in his way.

00:17:36.003 --> 00:17:38.547
The suit of armor is
one of his favorite targets,

00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:42.384
naturally, when he does not
have anything better to shoot.

00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:46.722
Well, I'll be kind of curious
to meet this brother of yours.

00:17:47.598 --> 00:17:48.766
Ah.

00:17:49.308 --> 00:17:52.895
This is Chico,
one of the most trusted of my men.

00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:56.315
Follow him.
He will bring you to your room.

00:17:56.398 --> 00:17:58.942
I would like you
to feel at home.

00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:02.279
Well, I never found home
that great, but let's go.

00:18:20.589 --> 00:18:22.341
Who's that?

00:18:22.424 --> 00:18:26.512
Her name's Marisol.
You just forget about her.

00:18:29.682 --> 00:18:31.850
This one will be your room.

00:19:02.965 --> 00:19:04.550
You gave him $100.

00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:05.592
Yes.

00:19:05.676 --> 00:19:07.761
We never pay that much.

00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:10.055
Can you explain to me
why you have taken him on?

00:19:10.139 --> 00:19:13.642
To have that filthy gringo around the
house and to give him $100 besides?

00:19:14.143 --> 00:19:16.854
We have never paid
anybody so much.

00:19:16.937 --> 00:19:19.565
You cannot leave someone like that
to do what he wants around here.

00:19:19.648 --> 00:19:24.278
He's capable of doing anything.
And I want law and order in this place.

00:19:24.403 --> 00:19:28.949
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

00:19:29.032 --> 00:19:31.201
Just snuff him out.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.289
And who will be
the one? You?

00:19:35.372 --> 00:19:37.374
Yes, why not?

00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:38.584
A shot in his back,

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:41.837
and then you would have him out
of the way in no time at all.

00:19:43.172 --> 00:19:46.925
Listen, I could do it
easily right now.

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:51.680
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the 100.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.687
You're stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!

00:19:58.896 --> 00:20:02.107
A bullet in the back, eh?
And it is ended!

00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:04.777
And what happens if your hand
should tremble slightly?

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.612
And he's only been hurt?

00:20:06.695 --> 00:20:11.408
And with the cavalry arriving in town
and that Yankee so quick on the draw.

00:20:11.492 --> 00:20:12.493
I was
only thinking...

00:20:12.576 --> 00:20:14.203
You mustn't
think of anything!

00:20:14.286 --> 00:20:16.371
You let me
do the thinking instead.

00:20:16.455 --> 00:20:21.210
Go and see the americano.
Just ask him if he needs anything and make friends.

00:20:22.753 --> 00:20:24.880
Get one thing clear
in that head of yours.

00:20:24.963 --> 00:20:28.342
This is going to be a quiet
town until Ramon gets back!

00:20:29.635 --> 00:20:32.888
Is that clear?
A quiet town.

00:20:46.485 --> 00:20:49.488
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to...

00:20:54.368 --> 00:20:56.286
What are you doing?

00:20:57.371 --> 00:20:59.414
Moving.

00:20:59.498 --> 00:21:02.167
But didn't you know all our
men live here with us?

00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:09.925
That's all very cozy, but I don't
find you men all that appealing.

00:21:10.175 --> 00:21:14.471
Besides, your brother said he didn't
have any need for me any more right now.

00:21:38.078 --> 00:21:39.872
Halt!

00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:43.709
&lt;i&gt;Sergeant?
Yes, Capitan?&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:45.127 --> 00:21:47.713
Tell the men we'll be spending
tonight here in this place.

00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:49.882
Arrange it so they can
pick up the supplies here.

00:21:49.965 --> 00:21:52.467
Also, double the guard in order
to watch the stagecoach there.

00:21:52.551 --> 00:21:54.219
Yes, sir.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.639
Now what do you suppose they're
carrying in that coach?

00:21:57.723 --> 00:21:59.558
It'd be easy
to find out.

00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:02.102
Get up close to it and take a
little look at what's in it.

00:22:02.185 --> 00:22:04.813
If they fire at you,
you know it's gold.

00:22:05.188 --> 00:22:06.732
Not a bad idea.

00:22:20.871 --> 00:22:21.955
Mmm.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.302
Looking for anything?

00:22:36.595 --> 00:22:38.013
Hello.

00:22:38.347 --> 00:22:39.514
Get out of here, Yankee.

00:22:54.112 --> 00:22:56.031
Why aren't you sleeping?

00:22:56.949 --> 00:23:00.160
When I see you staring
like that, it bothers me.

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:03.830
I still keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

00:23:03.914 --> 00:23:07.042
It's something they seem to
think is very important.

00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:11.505
I asked a few questions of the
captain and almost was arrested.

00:23:12.547 --> 00:23:14.383
Who's Marisol?

00:23:15.801 --> 00:23:18.845
You better get some sleep.
You need it.

00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:21.390
It's much too dangerous,
even for you.

00:23:23.225 --> 00:23:25.727
All I did is ask
who she was.

00:23:26.812 --> 00:23:28.730
She is a woman.

00:23:28.814 --> 00:23:31.233
And Ramon's madly
in love with her.

00:23:31.316 --> 00:23:33.360
Does that make it
clear to you?

00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:39.157
Everybody in this town
talks about Ramon.

00:23:39.241 --> 00:23:41.368
Kind of curious
to meet him.

00:23:41.576 --> 00:23:45.998
If you are smart, you will try to stay
clear of Ramon as long as possible

00:23:52.546 --> 00:23:56.591
There are the soldiers.
They are moving on very quietly.

00:24:01.304 --> 00:24:03.223
Strange.

00:24:03.306 --> 00:24:05.934
They're headed
for the frontier.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:11.648
Tell me,

00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:16.194
is that the way
you go to bed every night?

00:24:17.362 --> 00:24:20.323
Don't worry.
I didn't dirty the sheets.

00:24:21.783 --> 00:24:24.077
No, wait.
I'm coming, too.

00:24:24.161 --> 00:24:27.664
I want to see for myself how you're
going to get yourself in trouble.

00:24:27.748 --> 00:24:29.791
All right. All right.
Go ahead.

00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:17.631
It's like playing
cowboys and Indians.

00:25:21.343 --> 00:25:23.470
Captain.
Welcome, Lieutenant.

00:25:24.846 --> 00:25:27.140
There is your gold
as promised.

00:25:27.224 --> 00:25:30.811
I hope the guns you will be giving us
will be equally useful to our army.

00:25:30.894 --> 00:25:34.272
Rest assured, Captain.
We'll check them over together.

00:27:08.116 --> 00:27:10.785
Get their clothes on again,
and hurry.

00:27:12.704 --> 00:27:14.372
Be sure to place them around right.

00:27:14.456 --> 00:27:16.458
Remember. They died
fighting among themselves.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.478
Rubio!

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.361
There. It's Ramon.

00:27:58.375 --> 00:28:00.961
This is my brother Ramon.

00:28:01.044 --> 00:28:03.088
I think
I mentioned him.

00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:04.923
Everybody talks
about Ramon.

00:28:05.006 --> 00:28:09.010
And many speak of you, too,
my dear brother included.

00:28:09.177 --> 00:28:12.764
Well, I hope
they say nice things.

00:28:14.015 --> 00:28:16.017
Did you have a good trip?

00:28:16.434 --> 00:28:18.353
It was tiring.

00:28:18.436 --> 00:28:21.481
It was terribly hot
on the road during the day.

00:28:21.564 --> 00:28:25.777
And stagecoaches are an
uncomfortable way to travel.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.197
Well, I'm sure you'll be
in great shape in no time.

00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:32.784
The americano cannot
wait to get into action.

00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:35.912
I am sorry. He's going
to be a disappointed man.

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:37.455
How's that?

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:39.457
The Baxters accepted
the invitation.

00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:42.043
They'll come tonight,
Don Miguel.

00:28:42.419 --> 00:28:44.629
The Baxters coming here?
You must be out of your head.

00:28:44.713 --> 00:28:47.716
Chico followed my orders.
I told him to invite them here.

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:49.843
Ramon,
what is this?

00:28:51.261 --> 00:28:53.638
I have found out many things
when I was traveling,

00:28:53.722 --> 00:28:57.142
and I have decided
that it's very stupid,

00:28:57.225 --> 00:29:01.313
to just keep on shooting at each
other and without any results.

00:29:01.396 --> 00:29:03.815
You've gone out of
your mind, Ramon.

00:29:03.898 --> 00:29:06.735
No, I have come
to my senses, Esteban.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.195
Believe me.

00:29:09.362 --> 00:29:10.739
Trust me.

00:29:11.823 --> 00:29:13.992
Life can be
so precious.

00:29:14.075 --> 00:29:18.330
It's foolish to risk losing
it every minute, no?

00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:21.833
There's plenty of space
for everybody in this town.

00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:23.918
Even Baxters.

00:29:24.878 --> 00:29:27.255
For this reason,

00:29:28.256 --> 00:29:31.301
I've decided to hang
my gun up on the wall.

00:29:31.926 --> 00:29:33.970
I think that Ramon
has the right idea.

00:29:34.054 --> 00:29:37.932
I, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.

00:29:38.808 --> 00:29:42.145
This is all
very, very touching.

00:29:42.771 --> 00:29:44.689
You mean you don't admire peace?

00:29:44.773 --> 00:29:48.526
It's not real easy to like
something you know nothing about.

00:29:48.943 --> 00:29:52.655
Stay in San Miguel and you may
just profit from the experience.

00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:55.909
No, thanks.
I'll be moving on.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:04.751
Here's your money,
Don Miguel.

00:30:04.834 --> 00:30:07.087
I only used
a small amount of it.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.049
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

00:30:12.675 --> 00:30:15.720
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.

00:30:15.804 --> 00:30:18.431
You might enjoy
dining with us tonight.

00:30:18.598 --> 00:30:22.310
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

00:30:22.394 --> 00:30:25.563
I don't think they'd
appreciate my presence.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:36.533
I don't like that americano.
He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.

00:30:36.616 --> 00:30:38.243
At shooting a pistol
no one can touch him.

00:30:38.326 --> 00:30:39.327
I can see that.

00:30:39.411 --> 00:30:43.331
When someone with that face works with
his gun, you may count on two things.

00:30:43.415 --> 00:30:46.334
He's fast on the trigger,
but he's also intelligent.

00:30:46.418 --> 00:30:49.087
That makes him too dangerous
for you, I think, my brothers.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.965
And now that he's gone, will you please
explain to me that silly nonsense

00:30:52.048 --> 00:30:55.427
about hanging up your gun and
making up with the Baxters?

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.387
Is it possible,
old fellow,

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:01.266
that you'll never be able to reach
any conclusions on your own?

00:31:01.349 --> 00:31:04.686
Don't you think our government and the
americanos will find those bodies,

00:31:04.769 --> 00:31:06.771
and then start
an invesfigafion?

00:31:06.855 --> 00:31:08.440
They'll investigate,
all right,

00:31:08.523 --> 00:31:12.193
and we'll be quiet and
peacefully abide our time.

00:31:12.777 --> 00:31:16.448
We know nothing about the
massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?

00:31:16.531 --> 00:31:18.783
I arranged for the bodies
to be lying,

00:31:18.867 --> 00:31:21.661
as if both companies
killed each other.

00:31:22.162 --> 00:31:24.747
But do you think
they'll believe it?

00:31:24.831 --> 00:31:27.333
Yes, I think so.

00:31:27.417 --> 00:31:29.502
Because if they don't
find some guilty party,

00:31:29.586 --> 00:31:32.922
it would be a pretty good reason
to call off the investigation.

00:31:33.006 --> 00:31:35.717
Yes, but what
about the Baxters?

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.136
The Baxters?

00:31:38.887 --> 00:31:41.556
They want nothing more
than to live in peace.

00:31:41.639 --> 00:31:44.058
We'll let them have
their own way for a while.

00:31:44.142 --> 00:31:45.477
So forget
about the Baxters.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.564
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes.

00:31:56.112 --> 00:31:58.781
That was a fine idea
that you had.

00:31:58.948 --> 00:32:00.783
What was it again?

00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:02.619
Ah, yes, yes, Yes-

00:32:03.578 --> 00:32:08.166
The Baxters on one side.
The Rojos on the other.

00:32:10.084 --> 00:32:12.212
And you'd be
in the middle.

00:32:12.712 --> 00:32:15.632
The only problem is that
they've joined up.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.138
Now you are without a job, and you don't
have money to pay me what you owe me.

00:32:22.222 --> 00:32:25.683
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave here immediately.

00:32:25.767 --> 00:32:27.810
I will forget about
what you owe me.

00:32:27.894 --> 00:32:31.689
And you leave San Miguel and never
come back for the rest of your days.

00:32:31.773 --> 00:32:35.693
Joe, I have prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

00:32:35.777 --> 00:32:39.322
It's sitting out in the back
here with two empty coffins.

00:32:39.739 --> 00:32:41.115
What are you up to?

00:32:41.199 --> 00:32:43.493
Are you changing
your profession?

00:32:43.576 --> 00:32:45.954
If you want to go on
living, you'd better.

00:32:46.037 --> 00:32:50.041
In my opinion, you'll
make a fine pallbearer.

00:32:51.751 --> 00:32:53.836
Close this place
and come with me, huh?

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.216
Oh, close up? It's done.
Where are we going?

00:32:58.341 --> 00:33:01.803
I'd like to know where we are
going, or is it a secret?

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.683
Down by the river.
Have a look at some corpses down there.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.396
The Rojos say, "Come to
dinner," and we must go.

00:33:53.479 --> 00:33:56.024
But l don't
like it at all,

00:33:56.107 --> 00:33:59.444
even if they've granted all the
guarantees we've demanded.

00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:04.782
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything.

00:34:04.866 --> 00:34:07.619
You mustn't eat.
You mustn't drink.

00:34:08.494 --> 00:34:12.707
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

00:34:38.483 --> 00:34:40.985
Are you sure that
nobody has seen us?

00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:43.154
Only a ghost or two.

00:34:43.237 --> 00:34:45.990
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't joke about things like this.

00:34:46.074 --> 00:34:48.910
Ghosts are better left
where they are.

00:34:50.161 --> 00:34:52.830
You look as though this
place suits you very well.

00:34:52.914 --> 00:34:56.125
And if you go on like this, you
will soon be here permanently.

00:35:09.097 --> 00:35:10.181
I do not understand.

00:35:10.264 --> 00:35:14.352
Why is it with all those bodies down by
the river we are just burying these two?

00:35:14.435 --> 00:35:16.729
We're not.
We're not gonna bury them.

00:35:16.813 --> 00:35:19.023
What do you mean
we're not burying them?

00:35:19.107 --> 00:35:21.818
That's right.
We're not gonna bury them.

00:35:23.194 --> 00:35:24.445
If we are not going to
bury them,

00:35:24.529 --> 00:35:27.615
I would like to know
what we will use them for?

00:35:27.782 --> 00:35:30.785
Why are we taking
the trouble to do this?

00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:33.871
The dead can be
very useful sometimes.

00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:40.586
They've helped me out of
tough spots more than once.

00:35:46.634 --> 00:35:48.886
First, they don't talk.

00:35:50.638 --> 00:35:54.308
Second, they can be made to look
alive if I manage it right.

00:35:56.602 --> 00:35:58.229
And, third...

00:35:59.897 --> 00:36:02.191
Well, third, if you shoot
them, there's no worry,

00:36:02.275 --> 00:36:04.277
'cause they're dead already.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.653
Understand?

00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:08.990
It doesn't make a bit of sense
to me, and I'm getting out.

00:36:09.073 --> 00:36:11.200
I'm alive, and I want to remain
with the living, understand?

00:36:11.284 --> 00:36:13.161
And when I'm dead, I'll want
to remain with the dead.

00:36:13.244 --> 00:36:15.955
I would be unhappy if somebody living
forces me to remain with the living.

00:36:16.038 --> 00:36:18.166
I hope that's clear.

00:36:18.624 --> 00:36:22.628
And, also, I don't like the idea that
you've placed those bodies there!

00:36:22.712 --> 00:36:23.921
The man we buried
in that grave

00:36:24.005 --> 00:36:27.091
is the only one who ever died of
pneumonia in this cursed town!

00:36:27.175 --> 00:36:28.760
Take it easy now,
will you?

00:36:28.843 --> 00:36:32.597
These two friends of ours here
are gonna help me pay your bill.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.932
Get up there!

00:37:02.376 --> 00:37:04.962
The only reason they could
have to start a war with us,

00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:08.132
would be to kidnap you
from your husband's side.

00:37:09.342 --> 00:37:11.302
He's gallant, this Rojo.

00:37:11.427 --> 00:37:14.305
I really didn't think him
capable of compliments.

00:37:14.388 --> 00:37:19.143
And he's not. All that he says
is false, like his proposals.

00:37:19.227 --> 00:37:23.689
You women. If things aren't complicated
for you, you become suspicious.

00:37:24.232 --> 00:37:28.110
Yes, because to me, it
just didn't seem right.

00:37:28.194 --> 00:37:31.572
It went too smoothly.
I don't trust them.

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:34.242
You'd like to prove me
wrong, wouldn't you?

00:37:34.325 --> 00:37:36.244
Always the same thing.

00:37:38.246 --> 00:37:40.873
Good night.

00:38:18.953 --> 00:38:21.998
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:38:22.248 --> 00:38:26.627
I just want you to know why the Rojos
want to make peace all of a sudden.

00:38:27.795 --> 00:38:29.714
You see, there was once
a wagon load of gold

00:38:29.797 --> 00:38:32.300
that the soldiers were
taking to the border.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.269
John, come up here quickly.

00:38:49.317 --> 00:38:54.155
Sorry, but when a husband finds
a man in his wife's bedroom,

00:38:54.238 --> 00:38:56.866
you're never sure
how he's gonna react.

00:38:59.744 --> 00:39:00.953
Give him $500.

00:39:01.037 --> 00:39:02.079
How's that?

00:39:02.163 --> 00:39:04.582
Give the money to him.

00:39:04.832 --> 00:39:07.585
He has an interesting story.
Listen to him.

00:39:08.586 --> 00:39:10.588
That's the right idea?
You didn't misunderstand?

00:39:10.671 --> 00:39:12.590
I get the wrong idea
only when it suits me.

00:39:12.673 --> 00:39:13.841
- Ramon.
- What is it?

00:39:13.925 --> 00:39:15.760
The soldiers, the ones who
were escorting the gold...

00:39:15.843 --> 00:39:18.596
Two of those soldiers got away.
They are hiding out in the cemetery.

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:21.766
The Baxters.
They're about to capture them.

00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:25.895
Rubio! Get the men!

00:39:28.522 --> 00:39:30.608
You are well-informed, eh?

00:39:30.691 --> 00:39:34.779
A man's life in these parts often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

00:39:34.862 --> 00:39:36.989
Your brother's
own words.

00:39:37.198 --> 00:39:39.700
Tell me. Why are you
doing this for us?

00:39:43.245 --> 00:39:44.705
$500.

00:39:52.254 --> 00:39:55.216
With these two soldiers
as witnesses against Ramon,

00:39:55.299 --> 00:39:58.970
the government will be able to rid the
town of the Rojos and their whole band.

00:39:59.053 --> 00:40:01.722
Then San Miguel
will have just one boss.

00:40:01.806 --> 00:40:03.015
Hurry!

00:40:18.239 --> 00:40:19.740
Let's go!

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:24.370
Coming with us?

00:40:24.453 --> 00:40:26.497
Oh, no. When a man's got
money in his pocket,

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.749
he begins to
appreciate peace.

00:40:29.709 --> 00:40:31.127
Come on!

00:41:40.404 --> 00:41:42.740
Let's leave the horses here.

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:07.223
Who's there? Come out!

00:42:29.078 --> 00:42:31.122
What do you think?

00:42:31.205 --> 00:42:32.623
I don't know.

00:42:33.332 --> 00:42:35.501
There's something
about it I don't like.

00:42:35.584 --> 00:42:38.629
Too still to be wounded.
More like dummies.

00:42:38.712 --> 00:42:40.714
Sure, dummies that are very
interesting to the Rojos.

00:42:40.798 --> 00:42:42.716
Better hide. Hurry.

00:44:57.685 --> 00:44:58.978
What'll we do?

00:44:59.061 --> 00:45:01.230
Take two men and circle
around to the side.

00:45:01.313 --> 00:45:04.566
Try to keep them busy long enough
for me to get those two down there.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.111
Go on. Go on. Quickly.

00:45:44.231 --> 00:45:47.401
Keep me covered.
I am going to take care of those two.

00:46:24.438 --> 00:46:28.275
Listen, Baxter!
You can have them now if you like!

00:46:28.692 --> 00:46:31.445
Since dead men
can't talk!

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:45.709
It seems they didn't
like my joke.

00:46:45.793 --> 00:46:48.962
We'll let them go home
in a little while.

00:48:32.774 --> 00:48:34.151
Keep this bad boy
as our guest,

00:48:34.234 --> 00:48:37.237
only until Baxter leaves San
Miguel and heads for the frontier.

00:48:37.321 --> 00:48:39.114
Put him in the cellar.

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:47.498
Esteban, good work.

00:48:47.581 --> 00:48:51.710
With Antonio as our prisoner, the Baxters
are going to have to give in to us.

00:48:51.793 --> 00:48:53.504
Now we can make
any kind of demand.

00:48:53.587 --> 00:48:55.756
Don Miguel!
Don Miguel!

00:49:01.094 --> 00:49:03.555
What has happened?
Talk, will you?

00:49:03.639 --> 00:49:06.266
I don't know, but
somebody shot at me.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:07.893
Marisol!

00:49:09.394 --> 00:49:10.604
Marisol!

00:49:11.188 --> 00:49:13.440
Where are you, Marisol?

00:49:26.703 --> 00:49:29.706
It's strange how you
always manage to be

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.792
in the right place
at the right time.

00:49:38.799 --> 00:49:43.595
It's nothing serious.
A headache that will pass. She'll sleep.

00:49:48.141 --> 00:49:52.729
Keep your eyes open.
She's not to move from that room. You hear?

00:49:59.361 --> 00:50:02.239
I wouldn't mention anything
about me bringing her here.

00:50:02.322 --> 00:50:05.325
I wouldn't want the Rojos
to think I was on your side.

00:50:05.576 --> 00:50:07.160
Don't be worried.

00:50:07.327 --> 00:50:12.416
I'm a woman who's rich enough to
appreciate the men that my money can buy.

00:50:12.749 --> 00:50:14.418
I've been to talk
to the Rojos.

00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:16.712
They'll give back Antonio
in exchange for Marisol.

00:50:16.795 --> 00:50:18.880
It'll take place
in the morning.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.803
Very soon you are
going to be rich.

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:33.937
Yeah, and that's not
gonna break my heart.

00:52:17.082 --> 00:52:20.210
Where is she?
You said I'd be able to see her!

00:52:20.293 --> 00:52:21.795
Where is she?

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.173
I wanna see her!

00:52:25.257 --> 00:52:26.550
Come back here, Jesus.
Come here.

00:52:26.633 --> 00:52:27.718
Where is she?

00:52:27.801 --> 00:52:30.178
I want to see her!
I want to see her!

00:52:30.262 --> 00:52:34.099
Why can't I look at her?
I want to see her!

00:52:52.826 --> 00:52:55.537
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

00:53:20.312 --> 00:53:21.521
Mama!

00:53:24.608 --> 00:53:26.109
Mama!

00:53:26.193 --> 00:53:27.360
Jesus!

00:53:34.201 --> 00:53:35.494
Mama!

00:53:37.996 --> 00:53:39.039
Jesus!

00:53:39.122 --> 00:53:41.041
Mama!Mama!

00:54:31.424 --> 00:54:32.551
Julio!

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.970
Marisol.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:38.431
Get Julio.

00:54:48.817 --> 00:54:51.278
You were warned
to get out of town.

00:54:51.778 --> 00:54:54.906
Now I'm gonna make you
pay once and for all.

00:54:56.992 --> 00:54:58.785
Let him be.

00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:40.201
You better get going.
Ramon's waiting.

00:55:44.164 --> 00:55:47.083
And, you, get that kid
home where he belongs.

00:56:34.673 --> 00:56:36.591
A pig, that Ramon.

00:56:37.801 --> 00:56:40.512
Tell me, what's Ramon
got to do with them?

00:56:40.595 --> 00:56:42.722
You weren't told, eh?

00:56:44.975 --> 00:56:47.310
In this part of the world,
the story is very old.

00:56:47.394 --> 00:56:50.271
A happy little family
until trouble comes along.

00:56:50.355 --> 00:56:52.273
And trouble has
the name of Ramon.

00:56:52.357 --> 00:56:54.985
Claiming the husband cheated
at cards, which wasn't true,

00:56:55.068 --> 00:56:58.530
he gets the wife to live
with him as hostage.

00:56:58.613 --> 00:57:00.240
And the husband?

00:57:00.323 --> 00:57:03.201
Him? There's nothing
for him to do.

00:57:03.493 --> 00:57:05.870
The Rojos threatened to
kill his little boy Jesus,

00:57:05.954 --> 00:57:08.623
and he was forced
to accept things.

00:57:11.126 --> 00:57:13.211
That Ramon is smart.

00:57:15.171 --> 00:57:17.090
Where are you going?

00:57:20.635 --> 00:57:23.596
To the Rojos
to look for a job.

00:57:29.436 --> 00:57:31.688
I am glad we have
the americano with us.

00:57:31.771 --> 00:57:34.524
It's the best thing that could
have happened to us, you know,

00:57:34.607 --> 00:57:37.569
'cause if either government
starts an inquiry,

00:57:37.652 --> 00:57:39.654
we'll need every man
we can get.

00:57:41.114 --> 00:57:44.701
I guess you know to be at
war with the Baxters now,

00:57:44.784 --> 00:57:46.619
is worse than sitting
on a big case of dynamite.

00:57:46.703 --> 00:57:47.996
Where should
we put this?

00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:49.956
Put it over there.

00:57:57.464 --> 00:57:59.924
Come on, everybody!
Drink up!

00:58:31.664 --> 00:58:34.042
Good shooting.
Very good shooting.

00:58:34.209 --> 00:58:36.419
When you want to kill a man,
you must shoot for his heart.

00:58:36.503 --> 00:58:39.297
And the Winchester
is the best weapon.

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.842
That's very nice, but
I'll stick with my .45.

00:58:43.176 --> 00:58:46.513
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

00:58:46.596 --> 00:58:49.516
the man with the pistol
will be a dead man.

00:58:50.308 --> 00:58:53.269
That's an old Mexican
proverb, and it's true.

00:58:54.854 --> 00:58:56.773
You believe that?

00:58:58.233 --> 00:59:01.319
Paquito, take five men and escort
Marisol to the small house.

00:59:01.402 --> 00:59:03.613
And stay there
till I return.

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.665
Everything's
prepared.

00:59:13.748 --> 00:59:15.416
Do not be worried.

00:59:16.042 --> 00:59:18.044
I will return tomorrow.

00:59:18.128 --> 00:59:19.796
All the wagons are ready.
We can leave.

00:59:19.879 --> 00:59:23.800
Everyone, enjoy yourselves
during my absence.

00:59:41.526 --> 00:59:44.070
You heard Ramon.
Let's have a good time.

00:59:52.495 --> 00:59:55.915
&lt;i&gt;Do you remember
sweet Becky from Pike&lt;/i&gt;

00:59:56.249 --> 00:59:59.586
&lt;i&gt;She roamed the world
with her lover Ike&lt;/i&gt;

01:00:00.336 --> 01:00:02.297
&lt;i&gt;Ike and Betsy&lt;/i&gt;

01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:04.382
&lt;i&gt;Betsy from Pike...&lt;/i&gt;

01:00:08.011 --> 01:00:09.929
He weighs over a ton.
Of course,

01:00:10.013 --> 01:00:12.182
with all he poured
into himself.

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:30.969
Papa,

01:01:32.053 --> 01:01:35.515
did you not tell me
no one could go see Mama?

01:01:36.641 --> 01:01:38.101
That's right.

01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:41.646
Then why does that man
see her when I cannot?

01:01:44.774 --> 01:01:45.775
I want Mama.

01:01:45.858 --> 01:01:47.610
Go away
from the door.

01:01:47.694 --> 01:01:50.655
Quiet! Quiet.
We cannot show ourselves.

01:01:50.738 --> 01:01:52.907
You must remember that.
You must stay away.

01:02:04.127 --> 01:02:05.712
Hello.

01:02:25.648 --> 01:02:27.608
There's somebody shooting
up at the small house.

01:02:27.692 --> 01:02:30.945
Saddle the horses immediately!
Come on. Let's go!

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.933
Look out!

01:03:48.314 --> 01:03:50.858
Here you are.
Now, take this money.

01:03:50.942 --> 01:03:54.153
It's enough to live on for a while.
Now, get across the border.

01:03:54.237 --> 01:03:56.906
Get as much distance between
yourselves and San Miguel as possible.

01:03:56.989 --> 01:03:59.867
How may we thank you
for what you are doing?

01:04:00.159 --> 01:04:03.162
Don't try. Just get going
before the Rojos get here.

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.377
Why do you do this for us?

01:04:10.837 --> 01:04:13.881
Why? 'Cause I knew
someone like you once.

01:04:13.965 --> 01:04:17.051
There was no one there
to help. Now, get moving.

01:04:19.345 --> 01:04:20.763
Get moving.

01:04:22.223 --> 01:04:24.183
Get out of here!

01:05:06.392 --> 01:05:08.686
What do you see, Chico?

01:05:08.769 --> 01:05:12.190
They're all dead.
They massacred them.

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:13.733
They kidnapped Marisol!

01:05:13.816 --> 01:05:15.985
This looks like the work of the Baxters.

01:05:16.068 --> 01:05:19.655
Quick, let's get back before
they attack our house and the town.

01:07:14.562 --> 01:07:17.231
Chico, give out the ammunition.

01:07:17.315 --> 01:07:21.193
Esteban, spread your men around the house.
Keep your eyes open.

01:07:21.277 --> 01:07:24.322
Miguel, Paco, Vincente,
Martin, behind the house.

01:07:24.405 --> 01:07:28.284
Manolo and Alvaro,
come with me. Stay alert.

01:07:28.367 --> 01:07:31.871
The way they killed the men in the small
house, there must be a lot of them.

01:07:40.004 --> 01:07:41.922
It's a warm evening.

01:07:45.468 --> 01:07:49.889
One of our wagons lost a wheel, so we
had to turn back here to get help.

01:07:51.724 --> 01:07:54.018
One of the men tells me,

01:07:54.894 --> 01:07:57.521
the Baxters
attacked the small house.

01:07:59.398 --> 01:08:01.317
Do you know about it?

01:08:04.737 --> 01:08:06.906
Tell me what you know.

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:27.927
Well?

01:08:29.428 --> 01:08:31.347
Where did you hide Marisol?

01:08:34.058 --> 01:08:35.226
Rubio.

01:09:01.168 --> 01:09:03.879
You are thirsty.
You want to drink?

01:09:04.463 --> 01:09:07.299
No, no,
it is too soon to drink.

01:09:11.137 --> 01:09:13.097
Bring him over here!

01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:43.461
You are behaving
like a stubborn idiot.

01:09:43.544 --> 01:09:46.088
Tell us where Marisol is,
and it will all be ended!

01:09:46.172 --> 01:09:47.423
In a week,
you'll be back in shape.

01:09:47.506 --> 01:09:50.342
You'll get out and you can
go wherever you want.

01:10:01.771 --> 01:10:03.856
That's enough for today.

01:10:04.398 --> 01:10:07.818
Sooner or later, he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.

01:10:08.486 --> 01:10:12.281
Watch out he doesn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.

01:10:15.868 --> 01:10:19.497
But wait till he comes to.
This way, he hardly feels anything.

01:10:52.112 --> 01:10:54.532
I've had a poker hand waiting
for me for three days.

01:10:54.615 --> 01:10:57.952
Now I'm stuck here! I can't get to it
while I'm guarding this americano idiot!

01:10:58.035 --> 01:11:00.204
I think you will find this
more amusing than cards.

01:11:00.287 --> 01:11:02.623
All orders are to be sure
he does not die,

01:11:02.706 --> 01:11:06.168
and also make sure he regrets
the day he was born.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.506
The gringo is asleep,
I imagine.

01:11:10.589 --> 01:11:13.425
That's all right.
I'll enjoy waking him up.

01:12:17.323 --> 01:12:19.408
Esteban, what was that noise?

01:12:19.491 --> 01:12:20.826
I do not know.

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.995
I heard a yell,
and then a crash.

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:57.029
It's useless to hide.

01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:01.200
You're finished playing
the smart boy.

01:13:03.118 --> 01:13:05.037
Go up and look in the loft.

01:13:06.538 --> 01:13:08.999
And take a look
behind the barrels!

01:13:20.594 --> 01:13:22.554
Let's get out of here!

01:13:32.398 --> 01:13:34.775
Hurry! Quick!

01:13:34.858 --> 01:13:38.237
Hurry with that water!
Hey, you, come with me!

01:13:53.043 --> 01:13:56.672
Surround the town!
Block all the streets leading out!

01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:58.716
Find him for me!

01:14:00.092 --> 01:14:01.844
Esteban, search
the whole town.

01:14:01.927 --> 01:14:03.178
Follow me!

01:14:04.555 --> 01:14:08.017
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.895
Look in the stables, in every
corral, in the storeroom!

01:14:11.979 --> 01:14:13.647
Look for him in the church!

01:14:14.023 --> 01:14:16.567
Go in there!
Search every inch of it!

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:20.029
Search everywhere!
Rubio, in here!

01:14:20.863 --> 01:14:23.699
If somebody is hiding him,
burn their house down,

01:14:23.782 --> 01:14:25.784
and kill them like dogs!

01:14:25.993 --> 01:14:27.453
You, up here!

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.999
Look for him near the Baxters, but
take him alive! I want him alive!

01:14:32.082 --> 01:14:33.667
Alive!

01:14:35.210 --> 01:14:37.463
Rubio, in the bar.

01:15:08.077 --> 01:15:11.538
He says he knows nothing.
He's trying to be smart.

01:15:11.622 --> 01:15:13.540
Bring him here to me.

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.461
I swear I'm telling the truth.

01:15:17.544 --> 01:15:20.172
Well, you know nothing, huh?

01:15:21.924 --> 01:15:22.925
I've not seen him.

01:15:23.008 --> 01:15:25.094
Rubio, you take care of him.

01:16:06.635 --> 01:16:08.554
Where have you hidden him?

01:16:10.055 --> 01:16:12.349
I didn't...

01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:20.566
You're the right friend
for that filthy americano.

01:16:20.649 --> 01:16:22.568
And you'll end up
the same way.

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:25.529
We looked everywhere.

01:16:25.612 --> 01:16:28.323
In his cellar, in the
attic, on the roof.

01:16:28.407 --> 01:16:30.534
But there is no trace.

01:16:30.742 --> 01:16:32.661
I couldn't find anybody
there in the back room.

01:16:32.744 --> 01:16:35.831
I'm certain he has taken
refuge with the Baxters.

01:16:35.914 --> 01:16:37.207
The americano
isn't stupid.

01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:40.586
He knows that that's the
best place for him to hide.

01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:44.590
The Baxters, eh?

01:16:45.757 --> 01:16:47.843
Then better go
and get him.

01:16:51.889 --> 01:16:53.807
And that's for
being his friend.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.885
Curse them.

01:17:37.684 --> 01:17:38.936
Eh?

01:17:46.026 --> 01:17:47.486
Piripero.

01:17:59.081 --> 01:18:00.082
Come here.

01:18:00.165 --> 01:18:01.792
I can't see anybody.

01:18:03.043 --> 01:18:04.628
Come here.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.265
What are you doing
in there?

01:18:16.974 --> 01:18:19.184
Never mind.
Get me out of here.

01:18:19.559 --> 01:18:21.853
But you're not dead yet.

01:18:21.937 --> 01:18:26.066
I will be if you don't get me out of here, quick.
Get that lid down.

01:19:52.986 --> 01:19:53.987
Rubio.

01:20:16.051 --> 01:20:18.303
I see some signs of life.

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:21.556
Let's be ready when they
decide to come out.

01:20:25.685 --> 01:20:27.979
Don't shoot!
We surrender!

01:20:28.188 --> 01:20:29.189
Don't shoot!

01:20:30.857 --> 01:20:34.569
Stop! Don't shoot!
We're coming out!

01:20:37.572 --> 01:20:39.950
I'm surrendering!
Hold back your fire!

01:20:40.033 --> 01:20:41.118
Don't shoot!

01:20:41.201 --> 01:20:43.829
We're surrendering!

01:21:12.065 --> 01:21:13.400
Stop.

01:21:14.276 --> 01:21:16.194
I wanna take a look at this.

01:22:52.457 --> 01:22:56.378
Ramon, don't shoot!
We're coming out!

01:22:59.965 --> 01:23:01.675
We surrender!

01:23:01.758 --> 01:23:04.678
Listen, you've won.
It's enough!

01:23:04.761 --> 01:23:07.097
I'll get out of town!
I'll do whatever you like!

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.223
You promise that?

01:23:08.306 --> 01:23:10.183
I swear it, Ramon!

01:23:10.642 --> 01:23:12.644
You won't try a trick
of any kind?

01:23:12.894 --> 01:23:15.438
None! No, no tricks!

01:23:15.522 --> 01:23:17.816
I said before, I give you my word.
We'll leave!

01:23:17.899 --> 01:23:21.570
Are you sure? You had better
ask permission of your wife.

01:23:23.405 --> 01:23:26.032
Maybe she won't
be too happy!

01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:40.130
Antonio!

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.841
John!

01:24:07.782 --> 01:24:09.367
Murderers.

01:24:10.994 --> 01:24:13.622
They had no guns.

01:24:13.705 --> 01:24:16.541
Murderers!
I hope you rot in hell!

01:24:16.625 --> 01:24:20.587
May you and your brothers die spitting blood!
Curse you for this!

01:24:21.087 --> 01:24:22.881
Murderers!

01:24:45.528 --> 01:24:48.031
Let's go.
The show's over, anyway.

01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:55.664
Keep looking for him.
Search among those bodies.

01:24:56.331 --> 01:24:58.458
The filthy americano
has to be somewhere!

01:27:17.806 --> 01:27:18.807
Silvanito?

01:27:23.978 --> 01:27:25.980
Where's Silvanito?

01:27:29.234 --> 01:27:30.777
Any news today?

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.696
I have to tell you some
news that's pretty bad.

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:35.490
I hate to tell you
this, Joe,but“

01:27:35.573 --> 01:27:37.325
Where is Silvanito?

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:42.747
Silvanito, he was captured this
morning by those men of Ramon's.

01:27:42.914 --> 01:27:45.959
They grabbed him outside the village.
He was on his way to this mine.

01:27:46.042 --> 01:27:49.045
He was bringing in some provisions.
Ramon's got him now.

01:27:49.128 --> 01:27:51.130
He's being tortured,
but he won't talk.

01:27:51.214 --> 01:27:53.174
I know him well.
He's a stubborn man.

01:27:53.258 --> 01:27:57.262
No matter what they do to him, he won't
say a word, even if it means his life.

01:27:57.345 --> 01:28:00.431
Listen to me.
They'll never be able to force him.

01:28:11.734 --> 01:28:14.904
Now, old fool,
loosen up your tongue.

01:28:18.324 --> 01:28:20.285
O
Rubio!

01:28:22.829 --> 01:28:25.206
You better get back
to your shop, old man.

01:28:25.331 --> 01:28:26.708
You're liable to
have some business.

01:28:26.791 --> 01:28:28.209
Very good!

01:28:28.293 --> 01:28:30.211
That's what
I wanted to hear.

01:28:30.295 --> 01:28:33.548
And I have a little surprise
for you that I brought along.

01:28:33.631 --> 01:28:35.300
I know how much you
are going to need it.

01:28:35.383 --> 01:28:37.218
It was very hard
to get my hands on it.

01:28:37.302 --> 01:28:41.806
But I got it by first using my head.
No one can resist two barrels of wine.

01:28:41.890 --> 01:28:44.475
Isn't that right?
Then I thought that,

01:28:44.559 --> 01:28:48.396
well, you might need that pistol,
and I brought another present.

01:28:50.064 --> 01:28:53.985
It's dynamite.
I stole it from the Rojos.

01:28:54.485 --> 01:28:55.695
And now it seems to me

01:28:55.778 --> 01:28:58.656
the moment's come for
you to light the fuse

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.742
and send it
back to them.

01:29:20.136 --> 01:29:22.055
Still lots of light.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.478
Too early
to be asleep, yet.

01:29:32.357 --> 01:29:33.942
Rubio, here.

01:29:39.489 --> 01:29:43.826
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this.

01:29:45.328 --> 01:29:47.664
Listen, Ramon, let's try
it with this one now.

01:31:53.289 --> 01:31:54.499
Gringo!

01:32:01.756 --> 01:32:04.175
Heard you wanted
to see me.

01:32:05.051 --> 01:32:07.386
&lt;i&gt;The americano's&lt;/i&gt; dead.

01:32:08.679 --> 01:32:10.640
Let the old man down.

01:32:28.699 --> 01:32:31.119
What's wrong, Ramon?

01:32:31.702 --> 01:32:33.663
You losing your touch?

01:32:41.879 --> 01:32:43.297
Are you afraid, Ramon?

01:32:47.093 --> 01:32:50.471
You shoot to kill,
you better hit the heart.

01:32:51.514 --> 01:32:53.349
Your own words, Ramon.

01:33:09.907 --> 01:33:11.742
The heart, Ramon.

01:33:12.076 --> 01:33:13.995
Don't forget the heart.

01:33:17.081 --> 01:33:19.917
Aim for the heart
or you'll never stop me.

01:34:56.514 --> 01:35:00.017
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

01:35:00.518 --> 01:35:02.937
you said the man with the
pistol's a dead man.

01:35:04.146 --> 01:35:06.732
Let's see if that's true.

01:35:30.256 --> 01:35:32.550
Go ahead, load up and shoot.

01:37:38.008 --> 01:37:40.136
Hey, listen, Joe.

01:37:40.219 --> 01:37:43.055
Listen, Joe, I...

01:37:44.807 --> 01:37:46.934
Oh, Joe, Joe.

01:38:19.383 --> 01:38:23.596
Well, guess your government will
be glad to see that gold back.

01:38:23.679 --> 01:38:28.058
And you, you don't want to be
here when they get it, eh?

01:38:29.727 --> 01:38:32.771
You mean, the Mexican
government on one side,

01:38:32.855 --> 01:38:35.399
and maybe the Americans
on the other side?

01:38:35.483 --> 01:38:38.319
Me, right smack
in the middle?

01:38:38.402 --> 01:38:40.279
Mmm-mmm.
Too dangerous.

01:38:42.239 --> 01:38:43.491
So long..
