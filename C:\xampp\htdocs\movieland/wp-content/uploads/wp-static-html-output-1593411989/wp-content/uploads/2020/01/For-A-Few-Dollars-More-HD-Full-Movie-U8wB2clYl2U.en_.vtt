 Free movies online 

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.084
 Tickets. 

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:15.128
 Tickets please. 

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.090
 Tickets. Tickets. 

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.346
 thank you. Tickets. 

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.349
 Is it far from Tucumcari? 

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.143
 We should pass there in about three or four minutes. 

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.270
 thanks. 

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.690
 Excuse me, but you made a mistake, pastor. 

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.900
 I couldn't help hearing you going to Tucumcari. 

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.193
 L the goods wandering here, 

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.446
 And I tell you better you're on the wrong train. 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.411
 I think the nearest station to Tucumcari is Amarillo. 

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:51.540
 By getting off at Santa Fe and back by Amarillo, 

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.876
 You should be able to get it where you are going 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.882
 You see the train does not stop in Tucumcari. 

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.895
 This train will stop at Tucumcari. 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.548
 Take it easy, everyone! 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.593
 why did you stop? Did something go wrong? 

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.887
 Someone pulled the emergency rope. 

00:05:57.398 --> 00:06:00.650
 Hey, master, you can't pull out the emergency wire and jump. 

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:04.738
 Tell me, why did you stop this train? If you want to get off, you are ... 

00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:06.281
 Well, the rail company 

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.450
 It would be great happy to make any arrangements 

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:11.661
 For any traveler if you want to get off here, sir. 

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.663
 Thanks. 

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.668
 Well, let's go! 

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.754
 go ahead! Let's go! 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.083
 Guy passed through here in person and added these two zeros. 

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:00.419
 He was spitting insane when he saw what they were showing. 

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.795
 Not satisfied. 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.840
 He said, "A 1,000 bucks for me is very little. 

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.342
 "I appreciate so much more." 

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:08.802
 Right. he said that, 

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.805
 Then he added the zeros to the thousand. 

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:16.351
 No one has the courage to face this killer, eh? 

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.071
 At least it was that way until now. 

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:27.631
 where is he? 

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:38.225
 I have no idea where he is today. 

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.123
 -Proved. But, Jai ... 

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.168
 Still, he told me. - You hurt me with your hands 

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:08.255
 -Then as I tell you. - Stop it! 

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:10.966
 Look now, it made me drop the soap. 

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.720
 - Wait, I'll get it for you - You're killing me. 

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:19.724
 Look. What is that? 

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.185
 Excuse me, madam. 

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.154
 I will kill you for this. 

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.334
 Here you are. $ 1,000. 

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:04.723
 What do you know about Kavanagh? 

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.726
 Almost a week ago, he was seen in White Rocks. 

00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:09.394
 thanks. 

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.397
 If it matters to you, 

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.900
 Another person fell in to see me about him. 

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:20.113
 -Who is the? I will not see him before 

00:12:20.197 --> 00:12:22.574
 His name is Manco. 

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.159
 Light? 

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.081
 You know Cavanagh's baby? 

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.629
 Now tell me, you know where I can find it? 

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.972
 There, on this table. 

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.599
 He's got his back on you. 

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.479
 thanks. 

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.130
 Two cards. 

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:06.464
 I didn't hear what the bet was. 

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:11.719
 Your life. 

00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:42.959
 Live or dead, it's your choice. 

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.131
 Let's go red. 

00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:27.962
 $ 2,000. He has a lot of money 

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.090
 It takes me three years to earn it. 

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:34.719
 Tell me, he is not supposed to be a brave honest, loyal, 

00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:37.388
 And above all, honest? 

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.891
 Yes, this is. 

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.531
 I think you need a new sheriff 

00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:56.796
 Yuri. 

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:15.940
 Hasta Luigu. 

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:18.526
 Amigo. 

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.710
 How are you, Ninyu? 

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.628
 Better when I see you. 

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.643
 Follow. go ahead. 

00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:16.459
 open it. 

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.314
 -What do you do? who is this? -Rodriguez, Senior. 

00:23:10.847 --> 00:23:13.140
 you. Come 

00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:30.491
 I'll let you live, hero. 

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:34.745
 This is so you can tell everyone you've seen what's going on here. 

00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:31.469
 For the lousy money. 

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:34.555
 no no no. 

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:42.480
 She took money to put me behind bars. 

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.277
 You had to kill me when you could. 

00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:50.321
 It will be better for you. 

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:52.781
 And for them. 

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.329
 How old is the boy? 

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:05.127
 How old is the boy, I asked? 

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.713
 It is 18 months now 

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.217
 Only the time that you are in prison 

00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:16.597
 -You used the reward you got ... -Oh, no. 

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.724
 ... to start raising a family. 

00:25:20.727 --> 00:25:23.896
 For this reason I feel your family partially. 

00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:27.483
 I'll take a part of me now. 

00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:29.360
 Abroad. 

00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:35.115
 Both are innocent 

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.617
 Please let them go. 

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:38.577
 L was one. do you know that. 

00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:42.331
 Oh no. 

00:26:01.017 --> 00:26:02.059
 No! 

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:07.022
 I know. 

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:10.484
 I'm sure you hate me enough 

00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:36.844
 This time you'll have a chance to shoot me, but not in the back. 

00:26:39.514 --> 00:26:40.723
 leave it. 

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:49.398
 When you hear the music finish, start. 

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:53.110
 Or do you think you can? 

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:57.489
 Let's Begin. 

00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:55.399
 right Now. 

00:29:35.064 --> 00:29:37.649
 - Check these numbers again. -Yes sir. 

00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:43.113
 Good day, sir. Good afternoon. 

00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:44.782
 Mortimer. 

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.328
 Douglas Mortimer. -Mortimer. Virginia, right? 

00:29:49.412 --> 00:29:51.747
 -Carolina. That's right, Carolina. 

00:29:51.831 --> 00:29:53.749
 Can somehow help? 

00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:57.628
 - I am looking for a first class bank. Oh, but exactly 

00:29:58.254 --> 00:29:59.338
 Yes. 

00:29:59.756 --> 00:30:02.966
 The largest and most secure bank in the region. 

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.510
 Well, Mr. Mortimer, 

00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:07.012
 I want to assure you that our bank here has everything, 

00:30:07.096 --> 00:30:08.889
 All guarantees you are looking for. 

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:12.226
 I do not doubt it, but I have a large amount to deposit 

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.436
 Now, l'm suppose thieves. 

00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:18.857
 the thieves? 

00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:22.277
 A very dangerous road bar with gang killers. 

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:26.406
 Now what would be the most intractable bank for me to steal? 

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:30.369
 In your case, the only bank I would suggest is El Paso Bank. 

00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:32.955
 Not even lndio dares attack it. 

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:35.833
 It's not a bank, it's a fortress there 

00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:43.924
 -What time is the next train for El Paso? -1130. 

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:46.635
 I will telegraph to my colleague at El Paso Bank 

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:48.595
 You will arrive. 

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.721
 thanks. 

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:17.624
 Mr. Team Leader. General. welcome. 

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.543
 Do you need a stable or a room? 

00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.044
 Do you want to take a bath? 

00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:22.796
 My name is Fernando. 

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:26.049
 Stable here and this is your hotel. 

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:29.845
 Why is this hotel not some? 

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:32.639
 You probably won't like this other place as much, seÃ±or. 

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:35.309
 You will have to spend half the night shooting cockroaches. 

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:37.811
 In this hotel, the rooms will cost you much less. 

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.731
 And there is an owner in this one, Senior. 

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:44.359
 -Married? Yes, but she does not care. 

00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:06.506
 This is the bank. Once I get some money, I'll put it down. 

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:09.426
 Well, you should win it first 

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.180
 I have 50 cents here for you if you let me know 

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:17.309
 When anyone you have not seen before here in El Paso comes to town. 

00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:21.480
 At the hotel, Senior. A stranger just came from there. 

00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:29.613
 where does he live? 

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.290
 the hotel. 

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:47.381
 Let me know if you see any more strangers. 

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:48.840
 Certainly, Senior. 

00:33:04.732 --> 00:33:06.274
 Helped you sir 

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:08.276
 I want the room right above. 

00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:11.071
 I'm sorry, he's busy he's so bad 

00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:13.865
 The hotel is full of capacity. 

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.828
 I'm sorry. The room you want is our best. She is always busy 

00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:19.121
 By whom? 

00:33:19.747 --> 00:33:21.415
 Check the log. 

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:22.666
 Marie! 

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.628
 Lt's Senor Martinez. 

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.890
 -lt is free now. This room is taken 

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.561
 I will see it. 

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:50.402
 It is only an evil wild animal. 

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.738
 It is long, right? 

00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:58.702
 You are just dirty! 

00:34:11.257 --> 00:34:13.383
 Owner, fast! My bill! 

00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:16.178
 I want my bill! 

00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:19.765
 Before he comes here, give me my bill. 

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:21.058
 Oh no. There is no need to verify. 

00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:23.226
 I assure you that everything will be all right, Mr. Martinez. 

00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:24.561
 I'll give you another room right away 

00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:26.480
 -lt is the best in the whole hotel, the best. -No. 

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.231
 We'll leave him to the bridal suite. 

00:34:28.316 --> 00:34:30.192
 No, no, Mary, bill. I would like to stay, just I can not 

00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:32.736
 Not, go, Mr. Martins -l. You have an appointment somewhere else. 

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.404
 Senor Martinez. 

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.576
 Yes, Senior. what do you want? 

00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:47.250
 I do not wear it 

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:50.337
 I have honored you thought of me, thank you. 

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.794
 Watch this. 

00:35:55.903 --> 00:35:57.571
 Hello my friends. 

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.615
 Hi, lndio. 

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:03.910
 See, I didn't waste a minute coming here. 

00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:07.080
 Calls lndio and Groggy comes immediately. 

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.456
 And Sancho? 

00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:12.502
 If you wait for Sancho I will go and come back in about four years. 

00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:15.797
 He is in prison for four years. 

00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:19.426
 no love. Not Dinero. No sun. 

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:25.390
 Bad to him. Not so bad for the rest of us. 

00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:29.519
 A man caught not worthy of respect, huh? 

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:33.732
 What is everything, huh? 

00:36:34.066 --> 00:36:35.650
 Just now listen. 

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:41.406
 A bank in El Paso. 

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:44.951
 let's see. 

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:47.829
 We will say this is inside the bank. 

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.081
 El NiÃ±o is safe. 

00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:53.793
 That weighs three tons and cannot be opened with dynamite. 

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.880
 There is a part with two cashiers. 

00:36:57.673 --> 00:36:59.758
 This is the principal's office. 

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:03.136
 Right in the back is a luxurious wardrobe containing bottles 

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.097
 To deliver drinks to rich depositors. 

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:11.561
 There is the main door, and in turn, they built a double wall. 

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:13.813
 What happens, Grogy? 

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:17.984
 Suppose you have already killed the cashiers and the manager. 

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:21.738
 And in the next few minutes, you are the bankâs president. 

00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:23.573
 What now? 

00:37:24.992 --> 00:37:27.244
 Time is lost, lndio. 

00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:30.789
 Right, a waste of time. 

00:37:30.873 --> 00:37:33.875
 Especially, Groggy, to explode that iron ore is safe. 

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.797
 We must use so much dynamite that the whole bank will just disappear. 

00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:41.591
 And you will all climb with him. 

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:46.137
 And besides that, having a safe alone 

00:37:46.222 --> 00:37:49.432
 It doesn't always mean there's money inside. 

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:53.353
 To help you understand what it means, 

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:59.484
 I would like to tell a nice little story. 

00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.781
 Once there was a carpenter. 

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:10.245
 Don't think of a carpenter who can make money, eh? 

00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:12.163
 No? you are wrong. 

00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:18.628
 This one is good because it was the locker builder. 

00:38:19.922 --> 00:38:22.215
 There was a banker once 

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.260
 Who decides to be safe must have a disguised iron 

00:38:25.344 --> 00:38:28.221
 To look like a wood wardrobe. 

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.101
 To get that 

00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:37.272
 The banker goes to our carpenter for this position 

00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:40.317
 And one day, as his destiny, 

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:43.653
 The carpenter in El Paso. 

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:47.991
 It happens to enter the bank there, and what does he find? 

00:38:48.617 --> 00:38:49.826
 Council of Ministers. 

00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:54.414
 Since he worked in the cabinet, he monitored it immediately. 

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:57.584
 Since that day, he can no longer work. 

00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:59.461
 Pity, because 

00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:03.048
 There was something he had to do. 

00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:05.508
 There was this crazy idea. 

00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:10.513
 I stayed. 

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.976
 To put his hands on the money inside. 

00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:18.396
 Get in there and grab all the money. 

00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:22.817
 Sure, you think Carpenter was lucky the way things work. 

00:39:22.902 --> 00:39:25.945
 It was just lucky to go in this bank. 

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.572
 It was not true 

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.785
 His good fortune stopped on that day. 

00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:35.705
 Because later on, as a prisoner, 

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:40.251
 He ran into me. 

00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:49.052
 The carpenter told me the story, and I tell you 

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:58.645
 Money is not safe This is true in this 

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.733
 Nearly a million dollars in that. 

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:09.239
 Your Tucumcari colleague told me this bank 

00:40:09.323 --> 00:40:12.492
 It has the largest deposits in the entire state. 

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:14.536
 Yes, that's right, Mr. Mortimer. 

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.037
 Here at the bank in El Paso 

00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:19.207
 We have half a million dollars in reserve on hand. 

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:23.253
 I see. 

00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:26.131
 Are you sure this bank is safe enough to hold this much? 

00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:29.134
 From the moment your money is deposited here, Mr. Mortimer, 

00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:31.636
 You can sleep without any worries. 

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.181
 Beside that, 

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:39.018
 When the bank is closed, an armed guard always remains here 

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.479
 And patrol abroad. 

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:45.692
 Even San Francisco Bank is not well protected. 

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.695
 exactly. The truth is, Mr. Mortimer, 

00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:53.199
 To try to steal us would be very sterile 

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:56.286
 This only complete idiot will try it. 

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:57.454
 Yes. 

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.415
 Or a complete fool. 

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:14.304
 Get out of the way! Get out of here! 

00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:01.059
 More news, Amigo. 

00:42:03.646 --> 00:42:05.605
 Another stranger in the city? 

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:08.691
 Yes really. I know something else. 

00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:18.034
 There was another stranger that I didn't tell you about 

00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:21.412
 Listen to me, you slightly splashed off! 

00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:24.040
 I want to know how many men are together. 

00:42:24.124 --> 00:42:26.292
 Well, there were two. Now there are two more 

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:27.544
 Where? 

00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:30.046
 in the saloon 

00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:40.927
 whiskey. 

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.597
 Listen mister why do you choose My place to commit suicide? 

00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:47.600
 I know this guy it's a miracle that you are alive 

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:51.771
 Why should a man walk around with a gun and then let himself be offended? 

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:52.939
 It is so great 

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:55.650
 Sir, if your humpback does not call you, 

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.862
 He had a very very important reason, that's all. 

00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:03.074
 I was thinking to myself 

00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:06.554
 one two Three, 

00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:09.766
 Now four, and now five. 

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:14.228
 Seis, siete, ocho, 

00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:16.481
 nueve, diez. 

00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:21.068
 11, 12 and 13 

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:24.530
 14, 15 and 16 

00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:29.035
 17, 18 and 19, 

00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:33.080
 20, 21, 22, 

00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:38.002
 23, 24 and 25 

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:39.962
 26 ... 

00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:44.133
 27, 28 and 29, 

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:47.345
 30 and 31, 

00:46:47.888 --> 00:46:51.015
 32 and 33. 

00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:33.284
 no no no. 

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.705
 Now all right. 

00:48:39.499 --> 00:48:42.126
 I do not know him! I do not know him! I do not know him! 

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.211
 Come on, now, you know everyone. 

00:48:44.296 --> 00:48:48.132
 I don't know anyone anymore! I am dead! You understand? 

00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:50.676
 Well, there was a time when I knew everyone. 

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:53.596
 This was long ago when all this was wilds. 

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.306
 But these days, everyone is in a hurry. 

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.683
 That's right, with your damned good trains for nothing! 

00:48:57.768 --> 00:49:01.103
 Trains curse you! Trumpet Trumpet --- TWEE Trumpet! 

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.522
 Disgusting! 

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:06.150
 One day, someone from the railroad comes here to see me. 

00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:09.820
 "The Prophet, the railway, is going to go home again," he says. 

00:49:10.656 --> 00:49:12.490
 "Is this true?" I said. 

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.201
 "Yes, that's right," he says. 

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.328
 "All of these trains will go here in the past 

00:49:17.412 --> 00:49:20.331
 "The best thing for you, the Prophet, is to sell your land to the company 

00:49:20.415 --> 00:49:21.666
 Otherwise, we will buy a baker. 

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.376
 "He lives next to your place, 

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.962
 "And I'll put the tracks over there and that will make you feel crazy 

00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:28.881
 "What do you say? Will you sell to our company, the Prophet?" 

00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:31.425
 "Oh, is that so?" He says to. 

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.222
 He was very worried for me to sell it. 

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:38.516
 You know what I told about the railroad? 

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.560
 You know what I told him could do with his railway? 

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.832
 You know what my decision about selling was? 

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:06.293
 Well, I said no. -You are right. 

00:50:06.378 --> 00:50:08.212
 Not him and his damned trains. 

00:50:08.296 --> 00:50:09.797
 L don't! No! 

00:50:10.465 --> 00:50:13.259
 See, listen to me, old man. 

00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:15.094
 You are supposed to be a prophet 

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:18.139
 I did not come here to hear you rattle about the trains. 

00:50:18.223 --> 00:50:21.726
 You wanted to know this man, you obviously knew nothing 

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.645
 No need to be degrading. That's all I came here to do, 

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:29.066
 You can get out of my house quickly before I lose my nerve. You understand? 

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:36.115
 Hey! where are you going? 

00:50:38.827 --> 00:50:42.455
 I think better left before you go and lose your temper. 

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:45.082
 what is wrong with you? Why are you dang stupid? 

00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:47.626
 Hurry up. Give me that gun over there. 

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.587
 Yes, there is behind you. 

00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:51.297
 hurry! 

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.300
 Yes, yes, this is one. Now, deliver it. 

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:58.512
 This is. Give me this weapon. The man you asked for. 

00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:01.557
 There is only one question, how does he hold his pistol? 

00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:04.268
 Wearing it here, across his stomach? -Yes. 

00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:07.354
 Well, why didn't you tell me that in the first place, my son. 

00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.815
 Of course I know the guy you are trying to find out. 

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.692
 Of course I know him 

00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:14.028
 It is Colonel Douglas Mortimer. 

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.907
 Mortimer, a brave man, soldier. 

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:21.410
 He was known as the best shot in Carolinas. 

00:51:21.495 --> 00:51:23.079
 A great soldier 

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:26.832
 Now he reduces being a reward killer, the same as you. 

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:28.667
 Because of the trains. 

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.295
 Because of the damned trains! Damn them! 

00:52:58.466 --> 00:53:00.301
 Take her to the station. 

00:53:00.385 --> 00:53:02.386
 Leave the man. 

00:53:06.766 --> 00:53:08.017
 Catch him. 

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.855
 Take it back. 

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:17.443
 Take her to the station. 

00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:22.948
 Go inside. The station. 

00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:33.727
 Just like the games we know. 

00:55:29.242 --> 00:55:31.493
 He chooses it as a hoax, perhaps 

00:57:17.642 --> 00:57:21.979
 How can someone in my job go around with a suit like this? 

00:57:23.064 --> 00:57:24.648
 That heresy 

00:57:26.234 --> 00:57:28.444
 Almost sent you to your grave 

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:33.949
 You forget about one thing, Colonel, I was shooting your hat 

00:57:34.033 --> 00:57:36.285
 Well, I was just picking up on your hand 

00:57:37.203 --> 00:57:39.246
 But I remember shooting first 

00:57:41.332 --> 00:57:42.458
 Boy, 

00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:46.545
 I have reached almost 50 years of age with my system. 

00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.881
 Not many men last in these parts. 

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:51.258
 When do you expect to continue? 

00:57:52.927 --> 00:57:54.803
 Much longer. 

00:57:55.513 --> 00:57:59.266
 When I get my hands on lndio and $ 10,000, 

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:02.895
 I will buy myself a little place that might be retiring. 

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.396
 Yes. 

00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:07.566
 Well, I can't believe we should start another fight. 

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.651
 But you forgot one little detail. 

00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:11.028
 What is that? 

00:58:11.112 --> 00:58:13.572
 I want to get my hands on lndio, too. 

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.991
 Certainly, after me 

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.161
 Or before you 

00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.830
 Or at the same time. 

00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:26.668
 Is this a suggestion? 

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:29.755
 Equal partnership. 

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.549
 why? Why should l? 

00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:34.635
 Well, I can think of three reasons. 

00:58:34.719 --> 00:58:36.970
 First, there are 14 of them. 

00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:38.931
 Yes, that's a lot. 

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.349
 A lot to me. 

00:58:40.433 --> 00:58:43.060
 Yes. There is no small number even for the two of us. 

00:58:43.144 --> 00:58:47.439
 The second reason? 

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:53.153
 The second reason is you can make it 15 to 1. 

00:58:53.238 --> 00:58:55.906
 Don't forget, I want to play this game too 

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:59.952
 You know, when two hunters go after the same prey 

00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:02.120
 They usually end up shooting each other in the back, 

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:05.374
 We don't want that shoot each other in the back. 

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:09.920
 Then the colonel dies? 

00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:15.050
 Well, I would be generous 

00:59:16.302 --> 00:59:18.720
 You can get lndio bonus 

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:22.266
 And I will get the reward for the rest of the band. 

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:25.394
 No. Everything is wrong. 

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:27.980
 No, $ lndio is $ 10,000, 

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:31.233
 But the rest of the band adds to much more. 

00:59:31.317 --> 00:59:34.820
 Blackie deserves four, wild is worth three, El NiÃ±o two. 

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:36.238
 El NiÃ±o one. 

00:59:39.158 --> 00:59:41.159
 Well, Frisco is worth two. 

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:43.579
 Well, that is 10,000 dollars. 

00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.081
 Yes but 

00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:49.334
 There is more that will add more, I'm sure. 

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:52.754
 -how do you know that? I have my information, Colonel. 

00:59:52.839 --> 00:59:54.756
 You know, when everyone says and do it, 

00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:58.218
 I think I may take you on your suggestion. 

01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:03.348
 Let's drink to this partnership. 

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.272
 To partnership, with no tricks, of course. 

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:12.816
 No tricks. 

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:20.198
 Now, then, you realize, of course, 

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:23.702
 We'll have to figure this out some ways to get it in the middle. 

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:24.870
 Yes. 

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.914
 One from the outside and one from the inside. 

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:30.208
 There is no other way. 

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.128
 One of us will have to join the lndio squad. 

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:38.050
 Why do you look at me when you say "one of us"? 

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.801
 Because they do not know you. 

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.763
 The wilderness sees me and its hump will burn 

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:46.975
 Tell me, Colonel, 

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.228
 How do you suggest this for joining with lndio? 

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.814
 Maybe bring him a bunch of roses? 

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:57.444
 Well you can do that, but I suggest you take Sancho Perez from him. 

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:01.281
 Who is Sancho Perez? - A friend of lndio. 

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.241
 Now it cools down 

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.786
 He calm down in Alamogordo Prison. 

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.871
 How do you know all this? 

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:11.792
 I got my information too. 

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:18.006
 Of course, you'll have to arrange for his release. 

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.344
 Naturally. 

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.764
 Tell me, Colonel, 

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.100
 Have you ever been young? 

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.436
 Yes. 

01:01:32.146 --> 01:01:34.272
 And as reckless as you are. 

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:40.070
 Then one day something happened. 

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.115
 It made life so precious to me. 

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:45.200
 What is that? 

01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:52.541
 Or is the question not studied? 

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.418
 No. 

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.754
 The question is not thoughtless. 

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.049
 But the answer could be. 

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.536
 They told me that you put it away. 

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:19.331
 You will rest for four long years in prison. 

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:26.046
 No, lndio, for four weeks. No more than four weeks. 

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:28.965
 Sancho. 

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.517
 Who is this with you? 

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.771
 Take me out. The guy is a friend of mine. 

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:53.031
 Why did he help you? Did you ask that? 

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:57.535
 Yes. Amigo, why did you help me? 

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:04.417
 Well, there is a big bonus offered to all gentlemen 

01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:09.297
 That I thought might be the only sign in your next robbery. 

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.133
 It might just refer you to the law. 

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:55.760
 Amigo, 

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:01.016
 This is the only answer that will prove that you are okay. 

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:06.855
 I arrived at the right time, too. The task has already been set. 

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:09.232
 Tomorrow 

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.901
 the place 

01:07:12.903 --> 01:07:14.696
 The bank in El Paso. 

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:20.493
 Not far from El Paso there is a small town, Santa Cruz. 

01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:23.872
 Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico, Baku, 

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.417
 And you, Amigo, 

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:30.086
 The bank will be stolen in Santa Cruz. 

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:33.465
 Shoot, kill, get every pistol in the area after you 

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.508
 Especially from El Paso. 

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.970
 Anyone else around will take care of them. 

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:44.392
 Then after work, we will meet again in Las Palmeras. 

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.523
 where are you going? 

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:59.949
 Well, if there is any filming 

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:01.785
 L get my rest. 

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:17.592
 Oh Amigo 

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:21.429
 You know when I told that story yesterday, I fell for. 

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:24.057
 Great joke, isn't it, Amigo? 

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.776
 Who said I was joking? 

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.738
 I don't understand, that's right ... 

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:40.782
 Too bad you have to die. 

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.330
 What is that? 

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.014
 Now they should be in Santa Cruz. 

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.599
 Listen, little. 

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:37.023
 lndio and his band stole the bank here in town 

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:40.151
 Now why not just sit down and send the alarm to El Paso 

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:43.238
 And the rest of the cities here are warning them, right? 

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:47.200
 But sir, I have not heard any shots in the bank, and we are not sure. 

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:49.035
 You may hear one. 

01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:51.162
 The alarm clock. 

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.623
 Easy now. 

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.794
 They stole the bank in Santa Cruz! 

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:42.088
 Follow me! 

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.022
 Groggy, telegraph wires. 

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.680
 Good day, gentlemen. Happy day sir. 

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:25.061
 -Sir. -Good afternoon. 

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.297
 the other side. 

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.677
 11, 

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:04.470
 12 ... 

01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:08.599
 14. 

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:52.012
 Let's go! 

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:18.265
 what are you doing here? You do not run away, right? 

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:21.977
 No, I do not run away. I'm going after them and I'm going alone. 

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:23.687
 Our partnership is resolved. 

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.397
 Now, boy, let's wait and talk. 

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:27.691
 Yes? Well, all we did was talk. 

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:29.860
 I was reasonable without results. 

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.195
 Now take it easy. 

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:33.364
 We only knew Santa Cruz part of this plan. 

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:36.533
 Well, it was you who ended their strategy. 

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:40.162
 Now, I'm going to meet lndio. -I see. Better to go 

01:22:40.246 --> 01:22:42.164
 I will go alone. 

01:22:42.248 --> 01:22:43.540
 I have an appointment with lndio 

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.668
 I will not let anyone else interfere. 

01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:48.629
 Are you sure of that? That's right, Colonel. 

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:51.173
 Well, in that case, I'm sorry 

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.221
 This is not bad 

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:59.932
 Lndio sent four men to Santa Cruz. 

01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:03.185
 One man returns, a new man without a scratch. 

01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:05.229
 lndio is not an idiot. 

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.940
 When you ride with him again and show him that your little nick 

01:23:08.024 --> 01:23:09.817
 May believe you. 

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:11.902
 And don't forget that as of today 

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:14.780
 The entire gang is valued at $ 40,000. 

01:23:14.864 --> 01:23:18.075
 This is the bonus offered by the bank for the money. 

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:22.079
 Is the partnership working again? How do you think? 

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:27.042
 Try persuading lndio to go north, then go along Rio Bravo. 

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:30.337
 It is a good place for ambush and we can get it between two fires. 

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:33.966
 Yes. You're on the outside. I'm on the inside, right? 

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.344
 north? 

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.349
 north. 

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.661
 Yuri. 

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:12.755
 Wait a minute. 

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:16.050
 We need time to open it and this is not the place to be. 

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:46.830
 And others? 

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.415
 -dead? -Yes. 

01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:54.046
 After Santa Cruz, we headed to El Paso and beat us from all sides. 

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:59.343
 And it saved your skin. Is not this right? You are yellow ... 

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:20.989
 You made a part of it. Let's go. 

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.450
 Which way are we heading? 

01:25:24.577 --> 01:25:25.786
 north. 

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:28.789
 north? Along the Rio Bravo Canyon? 

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:30.624
 why not? 

01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:35.129
 Sounds like a good place to ambush me. 

01:25:36.714 --> 01:25:38.924
 Do you know a better way to go? 

01:25:39.008 --> 01:25:40.384
 Yes, south. 

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:44.304
 A ride to the border? 

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:49.309
 Yes, they will not expect you to cross the border now that the alert has been sent. 

01:25:53.773 --> 01:25:54.940
 No. 

01:25:55.024 --> 01:25:56.900
 I think we will go to the east. 

01:25:57.485 --> 01:26:00.320
 There is a place I know of Agua Caliente. 

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:04.700
 we are here. This is Agua Caliente. 

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.828
 Yes, I have many friends here. 

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:10.664
 It looks like a mortuary 

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.167
 But look. 

01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:16.170
 Lt can be one easily. 

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:20.757
 They don't like strangers, do they? No, they don't like anyone. 

01:26:22.385 --> 01:26:25.929
 Wild, you never saw our friend here shoot, right? 

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:28.891
 No. 

01:26:30.393 --> 01:26:31.935
 Are any of you? 

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.858
 We do not know how to be in an emergency. 

01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:42.237
 I was thinking, this is the right place. 

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:44.698
 I got a way you can show guys. 

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.577
 How is that? 

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.330
 Go to the city alone, Amigo. 

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:39.039
 Bravo. 

01:30:29.173 --> 01:30:32.175
 Do you mind telling me how you got here? 

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.177
 I just caused it. 

01:30:35.179 --> 01:30:37.013
 L figured you would tell lndio 

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:40.475
 To do the exact opposite of what we agreed upon. 

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.104
 He is suspicious enough to know something else. 

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:48.275
 Since El Paso was out of the question, well, here I am 

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.154
 Rum, double. 

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:55.282
 Tequila us all. 

01:31:11.048 --> 01:31:14.468
 Well, well, if it is not a smoker. 

01:31:16.804 --> 01:31:17.929
 OK. 

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:28.607
 Remember me, Amigo? 

01:31:30.693 --> 01:31:32.319
 Of course you do. 

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:33.904
 El Paso. 

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:39.576
 It is a small world 

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.162
 Yes, and very bad. 

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.707
 Now come on. You light up another match. 

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:50.212
 L usually smoke after eating. 

01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:52.881
 Why not come back in about 10 minutes? 

01:31:52.965 --> 01:31:55.675
 Ten minutes, you will smoke in hell. 

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.968
 get up! 

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.428
 Stay calm. 

01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:02.224
 On your feet. 

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.191
 Cuccillo, 

01:32:13.152 --> 01:32:14.694
 Count to three. 

01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:25.330
 One, 

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:29.918
 Two, 

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.380
 three! 

01:32:36.842 --> 01:32:38.051
 Stop it! 

01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:01.908
 who are you? 

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.913
 I am the one who can open the safe for you. 

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:12.252
 What is safe, seÃ±or? 

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.672
 One of El Paso. You got there before me 

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:17.674
 -However ... -However? 

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:23.263
 Open this security and half of the bank notes will be destroyed. 

01:33:23.347 --> 01:33:25.890
 It cannot be opened without detonating it. 

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.569
 - What will the cost be? $ 5,000. 

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:42.616
 Two is all I will pay you 

01:33:43.909 --> 01:33:44.993
 five. 

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:24.574
 Keep your hands off that! 

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:28.244
 The easy to steal problem is in maintaining the loot. 

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.788
 Take it out 

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:32.415
 Now, every man in New Mexico is after us. 

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.001
 All they have to do is catch some of us with some of that money 

01:34:35.086 --> 01:34:37.128
 And we will end up in the same way. 

01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:39.255
 We will wait here for a whole month 

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.257
 If you think it is necessary. 

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:43.802
 Then everyone gets their share. 

01:34:43.886 --> 01:34:46.596
 You will wait a month to get your money back. 

01:34:47.431 --> 01:34:48.765
 Naturally. 

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.309
 I will be in the pub 

01:34:51.394 --> 01:34:54.813
 The air around here stinks anyway, just like food. 

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.899
 But the month will go quickly. 

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:29.222
 OK. 

01:35:37.773 --> 01:35:39.149
 Here. 

01:35:40.317 --> 01:35:41.568
 Let's go. 

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:08.548
 I was worried about you 

01:38:08.632 --> 01:38:12.343
 All alone with lots of problems to solve. 

01:38:29.528 --> 01:38:31.279
 It is good here 

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:37.869
 go ahead. 

01:39:46.563 --> 01:39:49.732
 You don't have to shoot apples off that tree. 

01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:02.328
 Put it on. 

01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:41.844
 What is he doing now, this El Paso sheriff? 

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:45.181
 right Now? Looking for cash that was in the bank. 

01:41:46.308 --> 01:41:47.475
 right. 

01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:52.021
 He assumed that he would find the bodies of these men outside El Paso 

01:41:53.148 --> 01:41:55.274
 With so much money on them? 

01:41:56.985 --> 01:41:58.820
 What will the mayor think? 

01:41:58.904 --> 01:42:01.614
 Well, it is ... -right. 

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.111
 Moderately brown. 

01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:27.366
 What is it, El NiÃ±o? 

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:31.037
 Change plans. 

01:43:31.496 --> 01:43:33.706
 lndio wants you ... 

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:16.499
 Not loaded. 

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.776
 I think you should get out quickly now 

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.279
 Here are your guns without bullets. 

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:50.324
 Listen, don't let lndio find you both. 

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:42.418
 I know you don't like questions, lndio, but why do you do this? 

01:45:42.961 --> 01:45:47.173
 Nino, how long have you known that Manko fought a reward? 

01:45:49.468 --> 01:45:51.594
 I found out tonight. Why? 

01:45:55.057 --> 01:45:58.351
 I knew it was one of the first moment he arrived. 

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:06.525
 The other one is also a bonus killer. 

01:46:08.362 --> 01:46:10.029
 So I have an idea 

01:46:10.739 --> 01:46:12.698
 It will be useful to us. 

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:15.534
 We will try it. 

01:46:16.661 --> 01:46:19.747
 These guys are much better than mines with a weapon. 

01:46:20.582 --> 01:46:24.043
 So we'll let them all mingle in a gun battle. 

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:27.213
 But this doesn't really matter to me 

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.425
 and you. 

01:46:33.845 --> 01:46:36.222
 Because we will be far, right? 

01:46:42.354 --> 01:46:44.563
 And we will have all the money. 

01:46:47.609 --> 01:46:48.776
 Follow. 

01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:51.821
 Go on and wake up to Cuccillo. 

01:47:41.955 --> 01:47:43.581
 Who did it? 

01:47:43.665 --> 01:47:46.000
 Why don't you look at the knife? 

01:47:54.926 --> 01:47:56.343
 mine 

01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:59.054
 So it shouldn't be there, right? 

01:48:08.523 --> 01:48:11.692
 But I didn't kill him, lndio. I did not do that 

01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:15.779
 Cuccillo, hard to prove. 

01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:19.867
 lndio, l am innocent. 

01:48:21.203 --> 01:48:23.746
 One of your horses is outside 

01:48:24.372 --> 01:48:26.665
 Let's see if you can reach it. 

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:55.361
 lndio. 

01:49:09.543 --> 01:49:10.793
 Cuccillo, 

01:49:14.631 --> 01:49:16.382
 He just killed Selim. 

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:21.387
 These killers helped his bounty move away. 

01:49:26.017 --> 01:49:27.560
 I want them back 

01:49:29.187 --> 01:49:30.521
 right Now. 

01:49:33.316 --> 01:49:34.650
 right Now. 

01:49:36.987 --> 01:49:38.320
 right Now! 

01:49:44.035 --> 01:49:46.120
 what are you doing here? 

01:49:46.204 --> 01:49:48.706
 Go and bring them back! 

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:51.250
 groggy, 

01:49:53.169 --> 01:49:55.045
 These two murderers are bounty sitting on our backs 

01:49:55.130 --> 01:49:58.424
 And I tell you both of them must be killed immediately. 

01:50:02.887 --> 01:50:04.805
 We cannot let them go. 

01:50:19.696 --> 01:50:21.196
 We are finished now 

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:25.367
 Get ready to get out of here. 

01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:10.329
 Here, (Nino) -lndio. 

01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:13.165
 Catch him. 

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:20.381
 Not a bad idea, lndio. 

01:51:21.007 --> 01:51:23.217
 But I forgot one thing 

01:51:23.301 --> 01:51:24.843
 Open it now. 

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:49.118
 Okay, come on now, open it up. 

01:52:47.802 --> 01:52:49.470
 Lndio left me. 

01:52:52.766 --> 01:52:54.099
 OK. 

01:53:26.966 --> 01:53:28.759
 Where in hell? 

01:53:56.996 --> 01:54:00.165
 I will kill them, but I will lose his bravery first 

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.376
 I have a plan, Groggy. 

01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:10.384
 What? 

01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:13.428
 Let's just wait, Grogy. 

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:15.347
 They will return here. 

01:54:18.476 --> 01:54:21.103
 This way, there will be two of us. 

01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:24.022
 Can they go back here? Your men can kill them. 

01:54:24.107 --> 01:54:25.482
 Who is the? they? 

01:54:30.446 --> 01:54:33.532
 Are you sure about that, lndio? Did they do? 

01:54:36.536 --> 01:54:38.704
 I thought of something different. 

01:54:38.997 --> 01:54:43.500
 I made the boys go out to make sure they were killed and fast. 

01:54:44.627 --> 01:54:47.546
 I'm not stupid like the rest of them, lndio. 

01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:50.173
 There was no help for that. 

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:24.977
 Follow. 

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.336
 This hour, 

01:58:15.838 --> 01:58:18.632
 It has been a long time I wanted to ask 

01:58:20.218 --> 01:58:22.844
 L can see it means a lot to you, lndio. 

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:24.012
 why? 

01:59:57.106 --> 01:59:58.273
 lndio! 

02:00:01.194 --> 02:00:02.652
 listen to me! 

02:00:04.697 --> 02:00:06.698
 This is Colonel Mortimer! 

02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:11.036
 Douglas Mortimer! 

02:00:13.289 --> 02:00:15.790
 Does the name mean anything to you? 

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:51.094
 When the beats finish, pick up your gun. 

02:01:52.638 --> 02:01:54.681
 Try and shoot me, Colonel. 

02:01:56.767 --> 02:01:58.018
 Just try. 

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:56.469
 Very careless of you, old man. 

02:04:22.538 --> 02:04:23.788
 try this. 

02:04:31.547 --> 02:04:33.006
 Now we start. 

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:25.577
 Bravo. 

02:07:07.036 --> 02:07:09.621
 There appears to be a family similarity. 

02:07:15.878 --> 02:07:16.961
 Here. 

02:07:22.051 --> 02:07:24.677
 Of course, between brother and sister. 

02:07:25.387 --> 02:07:26.596
 My gun. 

02:07:32.019 --> 02:07:35.313
 My son, you have become rich. 

02:07:36.774 --> 02:07:39.400
 You mean we've become rich, old man. 

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:42.487
 No, everything is for you. I think you deserve it. 

02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:45.615
 What about our partnership? 

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.786
 Maybe next time. 

02:08:32.579 --> 02:08:35.707
 10,000 and 12,000 

02:08:36.583 --> 02:08:38.000
 15th, 

02:08:39.795 --> 02:08:41.462
 16, 

02:08:41.797 --> 02:08:43.089
 17, 

02:08:43.924 --> 02:08:45.591
 22 ... 

02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:47.635
 22. 

02:08:53.934 --> 02:08:54.976
 27. 

02:08:57.730 --> 02:08:59.355
 Any problem, boy? 

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:02.817
 No, old man. 

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:07.321
 The thought was having trouble with adding me. 

02:09:08.157 --> 02:09:09.907
 It is good now 

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:40.725
 English - United States
