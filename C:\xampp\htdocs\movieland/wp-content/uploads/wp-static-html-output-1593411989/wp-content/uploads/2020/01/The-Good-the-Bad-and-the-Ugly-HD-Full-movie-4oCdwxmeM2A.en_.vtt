 The Good the Bad and the Ugly 

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:14.712
 Translated by Mohamed Nasr 

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:48.243
 Ugly 

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.348
 From Baker? 

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.591
 He told Baker that I told him everything I knew 

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:58.866
 I tell him I want to live in peace. Understand? 

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.889
 I don't know anything at all on the subject of currencies 

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:07.312
 Now this gold has disappeared but if he had heard my words we could have avoided this together 

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.961
 I went to the military court there are no witnesses 

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:13.360
 They cannot recover again 

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.279
 I can't tell Becker what happened to the money 

00:11:16.383 --> 00:11:19.824
 Return you and tell him 

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:24.621
 There is talk about a visitor who came to you 

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:27.332
 And Baker knows this 

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:31.294
 His name is Jackson 

00:11:34.005 --> 00:11:35.465
 OK 

00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:38.072
 Jackson was here. 

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.660
 Or was (Becker) wrong? 

00:11:49.437 --> 00:11:51.731
 Not mistaken 

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:56.632
 Maybe Baker wants to know what happened between you 

00:11:56.736 --> 00:11:59.760
 About the cash box 

00:12:02.576 --> 00:12:05.704
 This is not what drove me to 

00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:13.837
 I'm only interested in the name Jackson is hiding now 

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:19.259
 Why do you think that Jackson might impersonate another name other than his own? 

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.283
 I will find it already 

00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:25.724
 When I start looking for someone I find it 

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.852
 For this they pay me 

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.525
 How much did Becker pay you? 

00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:41.990
 This is your family ? 

00:12:50.123 --> 00:12:51.687
 Yes 

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:55.337
 cool family 

00:12:56.588 --> 00:12:59.612
 How much paid you to kill me 

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:06.389
 five hundred dollars 

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:14.627
 To get the name 

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:26.305
 Carson ... Bill Carson. 

00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:29.955
 This is what calls himself now 

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:02.904
 This is a lot of money, a thousand dollars 

00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:09.265
 one thousand dollars 

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:15.312
 Some are gold. It is a large sum 

00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:21.360
 But when I get paid 

00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:24.488
 Always do the job 

00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:39.668
 it's you. Any information? 

00:15:41.962 --> 00:15:44.673
 Lots 

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.696
 He said something that will interest you 

00:15:47.801 --> 00:15:50.512
 One or two things will interest me 

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.701
 like what ? 

00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:56.768
 The name he hides ... Jackson 

00:15:59.688 --> 00:16:02.607
 This is yours 

00:16:03.858 --> 00:16:05.944
 Keep talking 

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:09.906
 He also mentioned something about 

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.034
 A cash box suddenly disappeared 

00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:15.015
 This is my concern 

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.205
 any thing else ? 

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.499
 Not enough in your view? 

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:23.670
 Well, you shouldn't worry. He won't say anything to anyone anymore 

00:16:24.296 --> 00:16:26.485
 Gorgeous 

00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:29.822
 please enter 

00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:33.367
 This is for you 

00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:35.870
 Your right .. five hundred dollars 

00:16:38.268 --> 00:16:41.396
 I almost forgot 

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.003
 He gave me a thousand 

00:16:44.107 --> 00:16:47.235
 I think he wanted me to kill you 

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:59.226
 Unfortunately, you know that when I get paid I always complete my mission 

00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.103
 You know this 

00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:03.919
 No I do not angel any 

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:30.508
 Wicked 

00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:50.215
 Not a gun, my friend 

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:54.490
 It will not be a beautiful thing 

00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:10.339
 We are three 

00:18:10.443 --> 00:18:15.657
 Do you know that you have a pretty face that is worth $ 2000 

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.558
 Yes 

00:18:20.662 --> 00:18:24.833
 But you don't look like someone gets it 

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:34.009
 Two steps back 

00:19:27.812 --> 00:19:29.794
 Thank you 

00:19:38.657 --> 00:19:40.951
 How much is it worth now? 

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:43.036
 How many ? 

00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:45.956
 Two thousand dollars 

00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:50.126
 True two thousand dollars 

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.942
 Two thousand dollars 

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:05.246
 I hope you end up in the graves 

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.374
 Cholera .. and the plague and plague 

00:20:08.478 --> 00:20:13.275
 Untie me, untie me, you filthy scoundrel! 

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:16.403
 I hope your mom ends up in a $ 2 bar 

00:20:16.404 --> 00:20:18.801
 Documentary jaw 

00:20:19.948 --> 00:20:24.849
 You will not be able to protect yourself, let me go and I will forgive you 

00:20:24.953 --> 00:20:27.038
 Let me go 

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:31.835
 I feel nauseous, and feel down 

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:36.840
 I am thirsty for water 

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.139
 Oh pig 

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:47.684
 Hey bastard 

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:51.333
 You are brave with a restricted man back 

00:20:51.438 --> 00:20:54.149
 Go back and kill 

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.130
 Oh rascal 

00:20:57.068 --> 00:21:00.926
 Who the hell is this? Rascal goes and another comes 

00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:04.784
 - Cut it out - I'm an honest farmer 

00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:07.078
 I am innocent of anything 

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:10.936
 So you are an honorable farmer 

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.543
 Do you know this guy? 

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.567
 Yes, it is you 

00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:20.634
 I? Who said that? You can't even read 

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:25.013
 Documentary jaw. I will suggest a good idea that you can develop 

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:28.662
 In hell with all your commands and officers. 

00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:32.103
 Look people he gives him dirty money 

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:37.630
 Judah, I sold my head, but you will not enjoy a single penny of this money 

00:21:37.734 --> 00:21:41.801
 It is fair for this money to go to the store 

00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:43.781
 Every penny from her, do you know who you are? 

00:21:43.782 --> 00:21:46.180
 Do you know the son of you? 

00:21:46.284 --> 00:21:48.786
 You never know, I know, everyone knows 

00:21:48.787 --> 00:21:52.332
 You are the son of thousands of fathers who are all miscreants like you 

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:55.252
 And your mother, your mother 

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.753
 Oh rascal 

00:21:57.754 --> 00:22:02.446
 Your mother is better not to talk about her here, so as not to hurt anyone's feelings 

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:08.598

 Marriage entitlements due to his wife and children

 Urging the practice of prostitution, kidnapping and rape 

00:22:27.367 --> 00:22:31.851
 Buying stolen goods 

00:22:31.955 --> 00:22:36.960
 Counterfeit money exchange and violating state laws 

00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:41.548
 The accused is convicted ... of rights 

00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:45.719
 Than it was obligated by the authority entrusted to us 

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:48.846
 Our judgment on the accused before us 

00:22:48.847 --> 00:22:52.705
 Toco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez 

00:22:52.809 --> 00:22:55.833
 Known as the mouse 

00:22:57.606 --> 00:22:59.691
 ..And any other pseudonyms our death sentence has been taken by death sentence to death 

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:03.340
 May God have mercy on his soul 

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.389
 Five for you 

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:35.664
 One ... two ... three ... five for my sake 

00:23:37.646 --> 00:23:42.234
 Five for you and five for me 

00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:44.632
 Do you know how much you deserve now? 

00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:48.177
 - No, how much? - Three thousand dollars 

00:23:52.035 --> 00:23:54.955
 There are two types of people in the world 

00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:59.542
 These are wrapped with ropes around their necks, whose job is to cut the rope 

00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:04.547
 I hear, the neck hanging in the rope is my neck 

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:08.301
 Next time I want more than half 

00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:12.993
 Maybe you take the risk, my friend, but I'm cutting 

00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:18.311
 If we reduce my rate 

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:20.605
 ! cigar 

00:24:21.648 --> 00:24:24.046
 It may affect my ability to target 

00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:29.260
 But if you fail, you have to make sure of it 

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:34.369
 Whoever aimed at me and did not kill me 

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.331
 He does not know anything about Toko 

00:24:38.436 --> 00:24:40.521
 He knows nothing 

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.839
 Wanted in 15 state districts 

00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:49.593
 The accused before us 

00:24:49.697 --> 00:24:53.138
 Toco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez 

00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:57.308
 A verdict of conviction from the third district court for the following crimes 

00:24:57.309 --> 00:25:02.314
 Intentional homicide and terrorizing Rape white virgin 

00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:05.755
 A second-degree crime of rape in brown color 

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:08.048
 Stop the train to steal his passengers 

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.238
 Oh Angel Eyes 

00:25:16.077 --> 00:25:19.727
 What's new with you, Shorty? If you asked me it would look like a book 

00:25:19.831 --> 00:25:24.002
 A military unit was guarding a gold coin box that met an Yankee ambush 

00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:29.007
 And only three of them were safe from Stephen, Baker and Jackson 

00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:31.614
 It is no longer safe and so are the currencies 

00:25:31.718 --> 00:25:35.680
 But the army, of course, decided to stop hearing the rumors and Jackson was discharged 

00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:38.600
 Then he disappeared and became Bill Carson 

00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:42.875
 I know this name but don't know just who to look for and I know 

00:25:42.979 --> 00:25:47.776
 When he appears, I am afraid to hit his shoes 

00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.591
 Where is Carson? 

00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:53.928
 - All I knew was that he had been re-enlisted. He lost one of his eyes 

00:25:54.032 --> 00:25:58.307
 He lives with a girl named Maria who will tell you that she is a new prostitute in the district 

00:25:58.411 --> 00:26:01.644
 where is she ? What is the name of the city? 

00:26:01.748 --> 00:26:03.521
 It is nearby 

00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:07.379
 Santa i 

00:26:10.507 --> 00:26:13.635
 Goodbye, half-soldier 

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.266
 Bring me one, whiskey 

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.559
 The officer’s office is in Sonora 

00:26:21.664 --> 00:26:24.792
 He appointed himself a guide for a train car 

00:26:24.896 --> 00:26:27.086
 And after he takes his wages in advance 

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.631
 He puts the cart on the ways for the Indians to steal it 

00:26:30.735 --> 00:26:34.593
 I am happy that they caught this man who committed all these crimes 

00:26:34.698 --> 00:26:39.181
 People who are stuck with a rope around their throats are not always destined to be hanged. What do you mean? 

00:26:40.328 --> 00:26:43.352
 Even a dirty beggar like this has a guard angel 

00:26:50.338 --> 00:26:54.300
 A golden-haired angel is watching him 

00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:58.159
 The defendant made a full and express confession to all of his crimes 

00:26:58.263 --> 00:27:01.808
 So we sentenced him to death by hanging to death 

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:04.728
 May God have mercy on his soul 

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:23.392
 Let's get out of here 

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:56.759
 what do you say ? Anyone can make a mistake 

00:27:56.863 --> 00:27:58.844
 Nobody makes mistakes when I'm hanging at the end of the rope 

00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:02.285
 Never wrapped a rope around your neck Well I'll tell you something 

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:07.707
 When the rope tightens on your neck, you feel as if the devil bites your bottom 

00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:11.774
 Yes, you are right 

00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:14.589
 It gets more difficult 

00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:21.263
 What I mean is saying that there is no future with a foolish dwarf like you 

00:28:21.264 --> 00:28:22.618
 what do you mean? 

00:28:22.722 --> 00:28:26.580
 Because I think you will never deserve more than 3000 dollars 

00:28:27.415 --> 00:28:29.604
 what do you mean? 

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.524
 I mean, our partnership is over 

00:28:33.671 --> 00:28:35.652
 no not You 

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:37.529
 You will remain documented 

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:40.656
 I will keep the money and you can keep the rope 

00:28:40.657 --> 00:28:44.828
 You filthy, bastard villain with all your dirty tricks 

00:28:44.932 --> 00:28:47.956
 The way back to town is only 70 miles 

00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:52.231
 If you organize your breathing, I think you can take care of it 

00:28:52.857 --> 00:28:54.004
 Good-bye 

00:28:54.108 --> 00:28:57.340
 Dirty bastard, come here 

00:28:57.757 --> 00:29:02.762
 Come here, and cut that rope down from the horse, you coward 

00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:06.099
 If I hold you one day, I will take your heart out and eat it 

00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:11.208
 I will skin you alive. I will hang you from the tongue of a pig 

00:29:11.313 --> 00:29:13.815
 I will kill you 

00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:20.280
 The same ingratitude after all the times you saved your life 

00:29:25.076 --> 00:29:28.048
 Wait a minute, it's only a trick 

00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:31.020
 You will not let me back here 

00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:34.878
 wait ! Hear, you blond dirty rat 

00:30:02.405 --> 00:30:04.491
 Sweet Dreams 

00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:18.046
 You are a dirty mouse 

00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:35.981
 Maria 

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:45.156
 Is that you, Bill? 

00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:47.138
 Bill 

00:30:56.313 --> 00:30:58.190
 who are you ? 

00:30:58.295 --> 00:31:00.276
 What do you want from me ? 

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.717
 Tell me about Bill Carson? 

00:31:03.718 --> 00:31:06.428
 I do not know him 

00:31:06.532 --> 00:31:09.764
 You call him in the dark 

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:14.769
 where is he ? 

00:31:14.874 --> 00:31:17.168
 What will you do? 

00:31:18.523 --> 00:31:20.817
 I will ask a question 

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.988
 where is he ? 

00:31:31.766 --> 00:31:33.642
 where is he ? 

00:31:33.747 --> 00:31:36.458
 where 

00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:38.752
 Where 

00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:43.652
 Enough 

00:31:44.904 --> 00:31:48.240
 I don't know where he took his belongings ten days ago 

00:31:48.345 --> 00:31:51.681
 He went with his unit, they all left 

00:31:51.682 --> 00:31:53.871
 which one ? Where did he go? 

00:31:58.042 --> 00:32:02.943
 General Sibley, the cavalry, went to Santa Fe 

00:32:03.985 --> 00:32:07.218
 I swear this is all I know 

00:33:32.616 --> 00:33:34.701
 But .. but 

00:33:38.872 --> 00:33:41.583
 I am very sorry, the shop is closed 

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.604
 Pistols? that's it 

00:34:27.254 --> 00:34:29.130
 Pistols 

00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:33.510
 Here I keep the best 

00:34:37.681 --> 00:34:40.913
 Remington .. Colt..Root 

00:34:41.017 --> 00:34:43.833
 Smith and Wesson 

00:34:43.937 --> 00:34:48.212
 Colt from the Fleet Jaslin 

00:34:48.316 --> 00:34:50.506
 Another Remington .. and this 

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.070
 its enough 

00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:37.636
 Shots 

00:35:45.457 --> 00:35:49.732
 If you want to try the gun, come on back. Let's go 

00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:56.822
 Move, move 

00:37:11.689 --> 00:37:13.774
 Shots 

00:37:21.699 --> 00:37:24.827
 How many ? Twenty dollars 

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.893
 No 

00:37:31.605 --> 00:37:34.628
 fifty dollars 

00:37:34.733 --> 00:37:39.216
 How many ? One hundred dollars 

00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:45.368
 Two hundred, that's all I have 

00:37:45.473 --> 00:37:47.558
 Here 

00:38:06.535 --> 00:38:09.038
 come here 

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.754
 Aaaa aaaa 

00:38:19.256 --> 00:38:22.593
 Shut your mouth, yes 

00:38:27.181 --> 00:38:32.394
 Toko, if you want to stay alive, why do you kill yourself with your deeds? 

00:39:09.723 --> 00:39:15.980
 If you want to stay alive, why do you kill yourself with your deeds? 

00:39:42.465 --> 00:39:44.550
 Potatos 

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.512
 You must be poor to eat potatoes 

00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:51.536
 Really poor 

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.186
 I am rich but lonely 

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.295
 The world is divided into two categories 

00:40:00.399 --> 00:40:06.447
 A class with friends and a single category like me 

00:40:08.011 --> 00:40:12.912
 Look ... I used to have a friend, Pedro 

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:17.395
 Chico ... and Ramon ... his sisters were also my friends 

00:40:20.941 --> 00:40:24.173
 But who knows where they are now? 

00:40:24.903 --> 00:40:28.761
 They are bad friends, bad luck because I didn't find you 

00:40:28.865 --> 00:40:31.159
 I will treat you kindly 

00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:37.311
 He's a big scoundrel who has 4,000 dollars 

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:43.776
 They are 4000 dollars, and I know where to find them 

00:40:46.174 --> 00:40:51.596
 If you helped me catch it, I'd split the money into four brothers 

00:40:52.118 --> 00:40:55.350
 Each one is 1000 dollars 

00:41:12.555 --> 00:41:15.683
 Are you in Toko? Is this true? 

00:41:18.498 --> 00:41:21.001
 And sang as you will be 

00:41:21.105 --> 00:41:24.024
 But people said you were killed in the yakraki 

00:41:24.129 --> 00:41:26.318
 But people say nonsense 

00:41:30.072 --> 00:41:33.409
 I'm alive, you bastard, and I'll always be 

00:41:33.513 --> 00:41:36.850
 And I came to give you 3000 dollars 

00:41:36.851 --> 00:41:38.935
 Vamos 

00:41:55.201 --> 00:41:57.287
 This morning I heard everything 

00:41:57.391 --> 00:42:02.500
 They say that Colonel Canby is with the northerners, and that tomorrow they will not pass unless they are in the heart of the city 

00:42:02.605 --> 00:42:05.316
 For this reason, southerners leave 

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.861
 Look when these cowards hear the blue shirts approaching, they are fleeing 

00:42:09.904 --> 00:42:12.823
 These revolutionaries have no intention of fighting. Oh, misery 

00:42:12.928 --> 00:42:18.245
 They'll finish soon, and then be a fortune behind these Yankees 

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.644
 They carry gold, not paper currencies 

00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:23.667
 And they go to defeat the south 

00:42:23.772 --> 00:42:28.985
 Look at this guy with the white beard sitting in the carriage, General (Sibley?) Looks dead 

00:42:28.986 --> 00:42:30.966
 Finally he will come out and invite us 

00:42:31.071 --> 00:42:35.971
 Long live the south, long live the south 

00:42:39.725 --> 00:42:42.749
 Where is the owner of this horse? 

00:42:42.853 --> 00:42:46.085
 Please, sir, my heart cannot bear where? 

00:42:46.086 --> 00:42:51.091
 The war really killed me. I'm looking for the owner of a horse 

00:42:51.195 --> 00:42:56.304
 He is blond and tall and smokes a cigar. He is a pig. Where is he now? 

00:42:56.409 --> 00:42:59.224
 Leave him alone, as he does not know every horse of its owner 

00:42:59.328 --> 00:43:02.977
 Silent silence, old hen 

00:43:02.978 --> 00:43:07.148
 Up, room 4, sir 

00:43:12.258 --> 00:43:14.552
 You heard? 

00:43:19.244 --> 00:43:23.206
 You rotten criminal, how dare you? 

00:46:36.837 --> 00:46:39.444
 Your reward 

00:46:53.625 --> 00:46:56.440
 There are two types of prizes, my friend 

00:46:56.544 --> 00:47:01.967
 This one comes from the door and the other comes from the window 

00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:05.199
 Remove the bullets from the pistol 

00:47:11.664 --> 00:47:13.124
 It is empty 

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:19.067
 And also my gun 

00:47:24.072 --> 00:47:27.826
 Even when Judas hanged himself, there was a storm too 

00:47:31.162 --> 00:47:33.561
 It could be a cannon shot 

00:47:33.665 --> 00:47:38.149
 Cannon shot or storm same thing to you 

00:47:39.713 --> 00:47:43.571
 Have you seen this before, my friend? 

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.249
 Hang it on the ceiling beam 

00:47:55.875 --> 00:47:57.334
 there he is. 

00:48:09.013 --> 00:48:11.098
 Stop this 

00:48:21.004 --> 00:48:22.880
 Right 

00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:25.383
 Now make sure the rope is tight 

00:48:25.488 --> 00:48:28.616
 To bear the weight of a pig 

00:48:34.976 --> 00:48:38.417
 Now place the rope around your neck 

00:48:44.256 --> 00:48:47.072
 Yes, very good 

00:48:47.176 --> 00:48:51.034
 It is wide on your neck? We will fix this right away 

00:48:51.138 --> 00:48:55.413
 I have another system that is slightly different from yours 

00:48:56.248 --> 00:49:00.523
 I don't shoot the rope. I shoot the chair 

00:49:05.006 --> 00:49:07.092
 Good-bye. 

00:52:16.656 --> 00:52:18.220
 Hello my friend 

00:52:18.325 --> 00:52:21.870
 If you are looking for summer vacation then you found it 

00:52:21.974 --> 00:52:25.415
 Our hotel is good and comfortable 

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.586
 And not only that 

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:33.965
 A healthy and useful food 

00:52:33.966 --> 00:52:36.051
 Corn seeds 

00:52:36.155 --> 00:52:38.657
 Our government holds us back 

00:52:38.762 --> 00:52:41.680
 As you can see, we are treating well 

00:52:41.681 --> 00:52:45.331
 Have you ever heard of someone called Bill Carson 

00:52:45.435 --> 00:52:50.544
 And you ? Have you heard of a person called Kandy? No? 

00:52:50.649 --> 00:52:54.924
 Well, you see, Colonel Yankee, who decided to separate us 

00:52:55.028 --> 00:52:58.156
 The only thing we care about is hiding our hideout 

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.180
 And you ask me, do I know someone !! 

00:53:01.284 --> 00:53:05.455
 I don't know exactly which thief you are thinking 

00:53:16.195 --> 00:53:20.366
 Carson has a patch on one of his eyes, it's the third 

00:53:22.138 --> 00:53:26.101
 If he has a third eye, all of them are lost 

00:53:26.205 --> 00:53:27.873
 For Glorietta 

00:53:27.978 --> 00:53:32.148
 The front front of Kanbi is completely left behind by these poor little demons 

00:53:32.253 --> 00:53:38.196
 And the desert in front of them I doubt that any of them are still alive 

00:53:38.197 --> 00:53:40.803
 And what if they were still alive? 

00:53:43.097 --> 00:53:45.391
 the worst 

00:53:45.495 --> 00:53:49.145
 Well, then, you must have heard something about Butterfly 

00:53:49.249 --> 00:53:55.088
 It is one of those American detention centers that you better not be in 

00:53:55.192 --> 00:53:57.695
 it's yours 

00:56:22.423 --> 00:56:26.489
 The well-known suspect Thomas Larson found Shorty Larson 

00:56:26.594 --> 00:56:29.096
 Guilty of the following crimes ... 

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.788
 Horse theft and army supplies 

00:56:48.282 --> 00:56:50.055
 And this short? 

00:56:54.851 --> 00:56:55.998
 No 

00:56:57.249 --> 00:56:59.856
 No 

00:57:00.169 --> 00:57:03.923
 Larson shorts hanged to death 

00:57:04.027 --> 00:57:07.259
 Perhaps the Lord will have mercy on his soul 

00:57:13.828 --> 00:57:15.392
 Sorry, my short 

00:57:16.852 --> 00:57:19.563
 Let's move on. 

00:57:44.171 --> 00:57:47.195
 I don’t know the more I come to the desert, the more thirsty I feel 

00:57:47.299 --> 00:57:53.139
 Incendiary? They say that those with soft skin can't bear much 

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.353
 As you are, you will not have to endure much 

00:58:21.396 --> 00:58:23.794
 Where are we going? 

00:58:23.898 --> 00:58:25.358
 Where ? 

00:58:25.463 --> 00:58:27.861
 Where am I going? My friend 

00:58:27.965 --> 00:58:29.738
 This way 

00:58:29.842 --> 00:58:33.700
 Another hundred miles of beautiful burning sand 

00:58:33.804 --> 00:58:36.411
 Even the army is very afraid to move forward here 

00:58:36.515 --> 00:58:39.122
 (Sibley's men) pull out there 

00:58:39.226 --> 00:58:42.354
 Kanby's men will come here 

00:58:42.459 --> 00:58:46.421
 But no one will put their foot in this hell 

00:58:46.525 --> 00:58:49.236
 Except you and me 

00:58:50.383 --> 00:58:53.720
 A hundred miles, this is a beautiful walk 

00:58:56.327 --> 00:58:59.768
 What did you say to me last time? 

00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:05.815
 If you organize your breathing, I think you can take care of it 

00:59:06.962 --> 00:59:11.446
 And if you don't take care of it, you'll die slowly 

00:59:12.697 --> 00:59:16.138
 Very slowly, my old friend 

00:59:20.205 --> 00:59:21.977
 After you please 

00:59:22.082 --> 00:59:24.167
 I start walking 

01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:22.098
 Do take a rest 

01:01:22.515 --> 01:01:26.894
 Come on, blond, not much left to go, just 70 miles 

01:01:28.145 --> 01:01:31.899
 Eight and a half hours before sunset 

01:01:32.003 --> 01:01:34.610
 This is not bad 

01:01:35.653 --> 01:01:37.008
 ! Come on 

01:03:27.535 --> 01:03:30.038
 Well, let's eat 

01:03:30.142 --> 01:03:33.896
 This is what I will eat 

01:03:35.669 --> 01:03:39.944
 While you enjoy sunbathing 

01:03:47.868 --> 01:03:50.371
 would you like some water? 

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:55.897
 drink 

01:04:01.945 --> 01:04:04.135
 Come on 

01:04:45.113 --> 01:04:48.450
 Well .. oh blond your day is long 

01:05:55.287 --> 01:05:58.207
 So, blond 

01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:02.274
 It is goodbye 

01:07:05.253 --> 01:07:06.817
 wait wait 

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:09.633
 Hey! 

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:40.721
 Water... 

01:09:48.124 --> 01:09:53.025
 Two hundred thousand dollars in gold for you, just give me water 

01:09:56.883 --> 01:09:58.969
 what do you say ? 

01:09:59.073 --> 01:10:02.827
 Who the hell are you? Bill Carson 

01:10:02.931 --> 01:10:06.268
 My name is Bill Carson 

01:10:06.372 --> 01:10:09.186
 sudden attack 

01:10:09.187 --> 01:10:13.775
 Everyone died. My name is Jackson, not Carson 

01:10:13.879 --> 01:10:18.467
 Okay, nice to meet you, Carson. I'm Lincoln's grandfather 

01:10:18.468 --> 01:10:23.055
 What were you saying about dollars? Two hundred thousand, all mine 

01:10:23.159 --> 01:10:26.183
 It was Caverly's third 

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:29.103
 Baker has nothing. 

01:10:29.207 --> 01:10:32.961
 Gold ... Gold hid gold in safety 

01:10:34.212 --> 01:10:37.132
 Where ? Here 

01:10:37.236 --> 01:10:41.303
 Speak at the cemetery 

01:10:41.407 --> 01:10:43.075
 What cemetery? 

01:10:43.179 --> 01:10:46.829
 On Sad Hill 

01:10:46.933 --> 01:10:49.123
 ... Here is a grave with 

01:10:49.227 --> 01:10:52.251
 What grave? Has a name? 

01:10:52.355 --> 01:10:57.152
 Has a number? Come on, you idiot 

01:10:57.256 --> 01:11:00.280
 There is no number 

01:11:00.384 --> 01:11:02.939
 It is a name 

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:05.493
 It is written 

01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:14.878
 Water 

01:11:15.921 --> 01:11:18.736
 Speak first. I'll get the water later. 

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.968
 Sad Hill Cemetery is well in the grave 

01:11:22.073 --> 01:11:28.120
 It must have a name or number. There must be 1000 or 5000 

01:11:31.665 --> 01:11:35.576
 Don't die, don't die. I'll get you water 

01:11:35.577 --> 01:11:39.486
 stay here. Don't move, I'll get the water 

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:42.510
 Do not die until I return 

01:12:07.639 --> 01:12:10.663
 Get away from there 

01:12:15.251 --> 01:12:17.440
 He died 

01:12:20.777 --> 01:12:23.175
 I will kill you 

01:12:25.156 --> 01:12:29.119
 If you do, you will keep the rest of your life poor 

01:12:29.223 --> 01:12:32.351
 Just a dirty mouse as you are. 

01:12:32.872 --> 01:12:37.148
 If I were you, I would have kept you alive 

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:40.276
 What did he tell you? 

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.778
 Noun 

01:12:42.882 --> 01:12:47.158
 -A name on the grave, what is the name? 

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:02.590
 Oh blond do not die 

01:13:02.694 --> 01:13:04.779
 Oh blond do not die 

01:13:04.884 --> 01:13:07.595
 Don't die, I am your friend. 

01:13:07.699 --> 01:13:10.201
 Please do not die, please I am your friend 

01:13:10.306 --> 01:13:11.870
 Come on 

01:13:11.974 --> 01:13:15.415
 Oh blond I will help you 

01:13:15.519 --> 01:13:18.543
 Don't move until I get back. I'll get the water 

01:13:18.544 --> 01:13:22.401
 Do not die as this pig. 

01:13:22.505 --> 01:13:24.591
 Water, blond? 

01:13:24.695 --> 01:13:28.345
 Don't drink. Not good for you. Do you feel better? 

01:13:28.449 --> 01:13:32.620
 Oh blond what happened? Do not die 

01:13:40.961 --> 01:13:44.246
 Open up! Faster 

01:13:44.247 --> 01:13:47.530
 Stand with you! Who is there? 

01:13:48.886 --> 01:13:53.265
 What does "from there" mean you think I'm the enemy? 

01:13:55.455 --> 01:13:59.417
 If you were an American, you wouldn't have had time to ask this question 

01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:00.773
 Come 

01:14:00.877 --> 01:14:04.422
 Sergeant, listen to this corporal for a moment 

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:10.366
 There is a wounded man here, if he is not dead 

01:14:11.721 --> 01:14:15.788
 He's alive, he seems to be ... 

01:14:15.892 --> 01:14:17.977
 what happened? It was a trap 

01:14:17.978 --> 01:14:22.878
 Only we both managed to escape the name, and travel papers 

01:14:24.025 --> 01:14:27.988
 Here. Corporal Bill Carson 3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Division 

01:14:28.092 --> 01:14:31.846
 Coming from San Rafael. Is that enough? 

01:14:36.434 --> 01:14:38.936
 Do you read with you and the man dies 

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.794
 Why, Corporal, we're lying here, but you're looking for a hospital? 

01:14:42.898 --> 01:14:46.965
 If you want one, search for it to make yourself an American prisoner 

01:14:47.695 --> 01:14:51.240
 So where are we? Near the Apache Canyon 

01:14:52.596 --> 01:14:55.097
 Apache Canyon? Apache Canyon 

01:14:55.098 --> 01:14:57.601
 San Antonio mission around us here? 

01:14:57.705 --> 01:14:59.894
 18 miles south, take it with you 

01:14:59.999 --> 01:15:03.648
 The brothers take care of all the wounded, whatever their color 

01:15:03.753 --> 01:15:06.776
 Be open-eyed, the area is full of Americans 

01:15:06.777 --> 01:15:08.445
 Thanks, bye-sergeant 

01:15:08.446 --> 01:15:10.426
 Take care of yourself 

01:15:29.195 --> 01:15:31.280
 Howe 

01:15:34.304 --> 01:15:37.536
 I have a very sick man but we do not have an empty family 

01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:40.143
 Let's take your bed 

01:15:45.044 --> 01:15:49.215
 Where is Pablo Ramirez? Father (Ramirez) will be back soon 

01:15:49.319 --> 01:15:51.717
 He will return during those days 

01:15:51.821 --> 01:15:55.992
 Never mind, now you have to take great care of my friend 

01:15:55.993 --> 01:15:57.869
 Let God be in his help if you do not know 

01:15:57.973 --> 01:16:03.500
 The Lord is on our side because he hates the Yankees 

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.818
 Father, is he still breathing? Yes, of course 

01:16:08.922 --> 01:16:11.007
 You are heavy 

01:16:21.851 --> 01:16:23.937
 over there 

01:16:52.716 --> 01:16:55.740
 Well put his compresses 

01:16:56.782 --> 01:16:59.598
 Put it in my room 

01:16:59.599 --> 01:17:01.683
 Hey! 

01:17:04.081 --> 01:17:06.375
 Get out, soldier, come on 

01:17:06.479 --> 01:17:10.337
 I take care of him please as my brother 

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:17.011
 my father 

01:17:29.732 --> 01:17:33.486
 Hey father did you talk? Did he say something? 

01:18:02.369 --> 01:18:05.392
 Did he ask about me? Did he talk about anything? 

01:18:05.497 --> 01:18:07.165
 No, he hasn't spoken yet 

01:18:07.269 --> 01:18:12.483
 But you should not worry, he is young and strong and this is what made him stay alive until now 

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.881
 He must recover in the near term 

01:18:14.985 --> 01:18:17.696
 Thank you, father, you do not know what this boy's life means to me 

01:18:17.801 --> 01:18:20.408
 Thanks to Christ 

01:19:09.206 --> 01:19:10.458
 Oh blond? 

01:19:16.088 --> 01:19:19.216
 Oh blond? 

01:19:37.359 --> 01:19:41.739
 The old father told me that you will recover within a few days 

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:45.701
 You're lucky to be close to you when this happened 

01:19:45.805 --> 01:19:49.351
 You think that if you can 

01:19:49.455 --> 01:19:54.773
 I mean when a person gets sick 

01:19:54.877 --> 01:20:00.091
 Good to have a close friend 

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:05.825
 Do you have parents, blond? Mother ? 

01:20:06.451 --> 01:20:08.849
 Not even a mother 

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.456
 no one 

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.001
 You are lonely ! Like me 

01:20:15.106 --> 01:20:17.921
 We are all alone in this world 

01:20:17.922 --> 01:20:21.049
 I have you and you have me 

01:20:22.822 --> 01:20:25.324
 Just for a little while 

01:20:25.428 --> 01:20:30.642
 It should have happened now. What a trick of predestination 

01:20:30.746 --> 01:20:34.813
 We could have got all the cash in our hands 

01:20:38.879 --> 01:20:45.344
 I have to tell you the truth, blond. If you were me, you would have done the same 

01:20:47.012 --> 01:20:50.245
 All this will end up for you 

01:20:50.349 --> 01:20:54.207
 Nobody can do anything 

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:57.544
 My God, forgive me 

01:20:57.648 --> 01:21:00.776
 It is my fault 

01:21:11.308 --> 01:21:13.914
 I'll tell you something, blond 

01:21:14.019 --> 01:21:17.668
 If I knew that in my last moments I swear to you 

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:21.943
 If I were in your place I would have done the same 

01:21:22.047 --> 01:21:25.593
 I was going to tell you about gold. I was going to tell you 

01:21:25.697 --> 01:21:27.991
 I was going to tell you the name of the grave 

01:21:28.095 --> 01:21:32.683
 After all this, what is the use of money for you if you die? I know the name of the burials 

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:36.020
 But you know how many graves are there? 

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:41.963
 I beg you. Please take some 

01:21:44.883 --> 01:21:48.324
 Coffee, please tell me? 

01:21:48.428 --> 01:21:50.931
 On the grave 

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:56.770
 If you got 200,000 dollars 

01:21:56.874 --> 01:21:59.898
 I will always remember you 

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:04.277
 I swear I will keep your memory 

01:22:06.258 --> 01:22:08.240
 I come close 

01:22:13.036 --> 01:22:15.121
 tell me 

01:22:16.581 --> 01:22:18.979
 You are dirty 

01:22:20.752 --> 01:22:23.255
 I will sleep better 

01:22:23.359 --> 01:22:27.842
 Because I know that my loyal friend. 

01:22:27.947 --> 01:22:30.345
 Beside me to guard me. 

01:22:39.104 --> 01:22:41.398
 Toko water, please water. 

01:22:41.502 --> 01:22:46.090
 But if I know the name of the grave, I will give you water 

01:22:52.242 --> 01:22:55.057
 Well, prankster, get up from your bed 

01:22:55.161 --> 01:22:58.915
 Come on, come on, the party is over. The cart is ready to leave 

01:22:59.019 --> 01:23:04.337
 It is better to get out of here before we get involved in the war 

01:23:04.442 --> 01:23:07.465
 Toko, Father Ramirez is back. 

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:12.470
 Something I have to do will take a minute, move 

01:23:12.575 --> 01:23:15.077
 Where ? From here. - Yes 

01:23:31.761 --> 01:23:34.054
 Hi, Pablo 

01:23:40.728 --> 01:23:43.335
 Don't you know me? 

01:23:44.899 --> 01:23:47.401
 It's Toko 

01:23:47.505 --> 01:23:50.529
 Let me hug you 

01:23:52.615 --> 01:23:55.743
 I don't know what to do 

01:24:00.018 --> 01:24:06.274
 I was just passing through. I said to myself, will my brother remember me? 

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:11.071
 Did I make a mistake ? 

01:24:11.592 --> 01:24:14.095
 Never mind, I am very happy 

01:24:14.199 --> 01:24:16.388
 You saw me, Toko 

01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:21.289
 OK ! I am glad I came 

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.005
 Sake this outfit 

01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:31.195
 it's a long story 

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:34.636
 Let's talk about you, you are the most important 

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:39.432
 You look fine ... maybe a little thinner but 

01:24:41.101 --> 01:24:44.854
 I was always skinny, Pableto 

01:24:45.793 --> 01:24:48.817
 What about our parents 

01:24:50.381 --> 01:24:56.220
 Just now you remembered them? It started after nine years 

01:24:58.097 --> 01:25:01.016
 nine years ? 

01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:03.832
 If they are nine years old 

01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:05.500
 nine years. 

01:25:06.126 --> 01:25:08.941
 Our mother died a long time ago 

01:25:10.401 --> 01:25:15.927
 Our father died a few days ago so I was absent 

01:25:17.491 --> 01:25:19.994
 He asked about you to be there 

01:25:20.098 --> 01:25:23.122
 But there was no one but me 

01:25:29.065 --> 01:25:31.255
 And you ? 

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:35.530
 Outside of evil, what do you intend to do as well? 

01:25:35.634 --> 01:25:40.431
 It seems to me that you have a wife somewhere 

01:25:41.891 --> 01:25:43.768
 Not one but many of them 

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:47.626
 One here and one over there, wherever you can find them 

01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:52.109
 Come on, preach me, Pablo 

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:55.550
 What use is that? 

01:25:55.654 --> 01:25:58.365
 Just keep on your way 

01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:00.868
 Go 

01:26:00.972 --> 01:26:03.475
 - God have mercy on your soul - I am leaving! 

01:26:03.579 --> 01:26:06.394
 While I am waiting for the Lord to remember me 

01:26:06.499 --> 01:26:11.816
 I'm Toko Ramirez, Brother Ramirez's brother, well I'll tell you something 

01:26:11.817 --> 01:26:14.215
 You think you are better than me 

01:26:14.319 --> 01:26:19.220
 From where did we come one who became a priest or thief 

01:26:19.324 --> 01:26:23.703
 You chose your way and I chose my path my way was harder 

01:26:23.808 --> 01:26:26.102
 You talked to my dad and mom 

01:26:26.206 --> 01:26:28.916
 Remember when you left to become a chaplain? I waited 

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:33.088
 I was 10 or 12 years old I don't remember how much, but I stayed 

01:26:33.192 --> 01:26:37.259
 I tried but useless and now I will tell you something 

01:26:37.363 --> 01:26:43.411
 You became a chaplain because you were more coward to do what I was doing 

01:27:00.824 --> 01:27:02.492
 Toko 

01:27:13.023 --> 01:27:15.213
 Please forgive me, my brother 

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.456
 Ha 

01:27:44.305 --> 01:27:48.163
 My stomach is full 

01:27:48.267 --> 01:27:50.561
 My brother is a good person 

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:53.168
 I didn't tell you my brother is in charge here 

01:27:53.272 --> 01:27:57.651
 Almost everything, almost the Pope, is responsible in Rome 

01:27:57.756 --> 01:28:02.969
 My brother told me, "Wait, my brother, don't go." 

01:28:03.074 --> 01:28:06.932
 There is a lot of eating and drinking bring your friend too 

01:28:07.036 --> 01:28:11.207
 Wherever I meet him he never wants to leave me 

01:28:12.249 --> 01:28:15.377
 My brother is obsessed with me 

01:28:18.923 --> 01:28:23.928
 That is, if even a traveler like me does not care about what is happening 

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:29.141
 I know that somewhere I have a brother who will not refuse me, a soup dish 

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:33.415
 Certainly 

01:28:33.416 --> 01:28:38.213
 Well after food nothing is better than a good cigar 

01:29:28.054 --> 01:29:31.182
 This is Sierra Magdalena 

01:29:31.287 --> 01:29:34.519
 Go this way, we will cross the Rio Grand 

01:29:34.623 --> 01:29:37.647
 It's a long way 

01:29:37.752 --> 01:29:41.818
 Northwest across all of Texas 

01:29:41.922 --> 01:29:44.112
 After that ... then what? 

01:29:46.197 --> 01:29:50.994
 When we get there, I'll tell you, don't worry. Are you worried? 

01:29:53.079 --> 01:29:57.459
 These guys aren't worried about anything, are they? 

01:29:59.231 --> 01:30:05.488
 Because I'm alive, I noticed that we had crossed enemy lines several times 

01:30:05.592 --> 01:30:08.824
 You must tell me where we are going? 

01:30:08.929 --> 01:30:12.995
 Up to 200,000 dollars, is that good for you? 

01:30:21.858 --> 01:30:23.944
 WoW 

01:30:32.389 --> 01:30:34.266
 get up 

01:30:34.371 --> 01:30:37.812
 Is there a blue or gray upcoming band? 

01:30:44.276 --> 01:30:47.926
 They are gray like us, let's greet them and then let them go 

01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:51.888
 Long live the union 

01:30:51.992 --> 01:30:55.329
 General Grant falls 

01:30:55.433 --> 01:30:57.310
 Long live the general 

01:30:57.415 --> 01:30:59.083
 what is his name ? 

01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:00.647
 Mine 

01:31:01.064 --> 01:31:06.173
 God is with us because he hates Yankees too. 

01:31:06.278 --> 01:31:10.031
 God is not beside us because he hates fools, too 

01:31:22.231 --> 01:31:26.298
 HP 2, 3, 4 HP 2, 3, 4 

01:31:26.402 --> 01:31:30.156
 HP 2, 3, 4 HP 2, 3, 4 

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:33.492
 Prisoners of war forward 

01:31:34.639 --> 01:31:36.308
 Advance 

01:31:36.412 --> 01:31:39.644
 Hebb, 2, 3, 4 

01:32:32.718 --> 01:32:35.429
 Forward see 

01:32:38.245 --> 01:32:42.832
 One class, move 

01:33:23.707 --> 01:33:27.043
 Jonathan Broad is present 

01:33:33.195 --> 01:33:35.906
 Ripchard Mobily. Present 

01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:39.869
 Nathaniel Sullivan is present 

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:43.414
 Robert Clarke is present 

01:33:44.144 --> 01:33:46.959
 Sam Richmond is here 

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:52.173
 Bill Carson 

01:33:54.988 --> 01:33:57.386
 Bill Carson 

01:33:57.908 --> 01:34:00.409
 I said (Bill Carson) 

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:03.225
 Blond, is this Angel Angel 

01:34:04.059 --> 01:34:10.107
 Well what does he do? Is he asleep Bill Carson 

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:13.131
 Yeah, and it'd better be Bill Carson 

01:34:13.132 --> 01:34:14.799
 Bill Carson 

01:34:14.904 --> 01:34:18.032
 its me 

01:34:26.061 --> 01:34:28.250
 Carson, please 

01:34:29.293 --> 01:34:31.378
 Say "present." 

01:34:32.734 --> 01:34:35.549
 Are you deaf ? 

01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:42.953
 Now you should say, "Present." 

01:34:45.038 --> 01:34:50.043
 I love the huge guys like you when they fall they make a big noise 

01:34:50.147 --> 01:34:53.275
 Sometimes they never get up 

01:34:54.005 --> 01:34:55.465
 Wallace 

01:34:57.029 --> 01:34:58.697
 that is enough 

01:35:01.617 --> 01:35:02.868
 Sergeant 

01:35:05.058 --> 01:35:09.229
 The leader wants to see you immediately 

01:35:10.897 --> 01:35:14.442
 I make sure that these two get good treatment 

01:35:23.514 --> 01:35:27.476
 Did you hear what he said? Good treatment 

01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:31.856
 Yes 

01:35:34.254 --> 01:35:37.799
 For the last time, Sergeant, I tell you 

01:35:37.903 --> 01:35:41.866
 I want the prisoners to be treated as prisoners 

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:44.889
 No more brutality 

01:35:44.994 --> 01:35:48.643
 There are hundreds of prisoners here and a few men to guard them 

01:35:48.748 --> 01:35:50.833
 I am forced to earn their respect 

01:35:50.937 --> 01:35:55.942
 I think you will earn their respect if you treat them better 

01:35:57.193 --> 01:35:59.800
 Are our soldiers treated like this in Andersonville? 

01:35:59.905 --> 01:36:02.823
 I don't care what they do in Andersonville 

01:36:02.824 --> 01:36:09.497
 While I am responsible here, the prisoners are not tortured, deceived ... or killed 

01:36:10.227 --> 01:36:12.000
 Is this an accusation? 

01:36:12.104 --> 01:36:17.318
 Sergeant, gangrene ate my feet, not my eyes 

01:36:17.651 --> 01:36:21.197
 I know that the captives here are regularly stolen 

01:36:21.198 --> 01:36:24.429
 I know that there is garbage or soldiers near the camp waiting 

01:36:24.533 --> 01:36:27.661
 For someone to communicate this booty 

01:36:27.766 --> 01:36:32.771
 But as long as I am the leader, I will not allow these games. Am I clear? 

01:36:35.065 --> 01:36:36.629
 Yes, sir 

01:36:36.733 --> 01:36:39.131
 As long as you are the leader 

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.781
 Yes, Sergeant 

01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:48.724
 I know that my feet mean that I will not stay long 

01:36:48.828 --> 01:36:55.502
 But I pray that I will have enough time to collect the evidence and send to the military court these conspirators 

01:36:55.606 --> 01:37:01.549
 ... who bring shame to the union's uniform 

01:37:05.825 --> 01:37:08.536
 I hope you'll find luck 

01:37:42.319 --> 01:37:46.595
 You and the others are best kept quiet for a short time 

01:37:46.699 --> 01:37:50.974
 I'll keep this. Go, Wallace. He'll guide you. 

01:38:00.775 --> 01:38:05.363
 Wallace brought Carson to me. Okay 

01:38:18.814 --> 01:38:22.881
 Angel Eyes tells us to hide for a short time 

01:38:22.985 --> 01:38:28.303
 But I will stay close enough to keep my eyes on things. Come on ride your horses 

01:38:28.824 --> 01:38:30.805
 Enter 

01:38:38.939 --> 01:38:42.067
 Come on, Toko, don't be shy 

01:38:43.422 --> 01:38:46.550
 There is no room for graphics here 

01:38:56.977 --> 01:38:59.584
 It is a long time 

01:39:02.608 --> 01:39:04.798
 You Hungry 

01:39:04.902 --> 01:39:07.613
 Sit down and eat 

01:39:26.069 --> 01:39:29.510
 I knew 

01:39:29.614 --> 01:39:35.662
 Ever since I saw you at first sight, I said to myself, "It's the vile, Angel Eyes." 

01:39:36.705 --> 01:39:40.146
 I bet he got an easy job 

01:39:42.648 --> 01:39:45.568
 He will never forget his friend 

01:39:45.569 --> 01:39:48.487
 I don't forget old friends, Toko 

01:39:49.947 --> 01:39:51.511
 OK 

01:39:51.615 --> 01:39:54.952
 It's good to meet my old friends again 

01:39:55.056 --> 01:39:56.619
 OK 

01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:00.061
 Especially when they come from a long journey 

01:40:00.166 --> 01:40:03.711
 And they have a lot to say 

01:40:03.815 --> 01:40:07.152
 And you have a lot to talk about, don't you? 

01:40:09.446 --> 01:40:13.199
 Catch you close to Fort Craig 

01:40:17.475 --> 01:40:23.939
 If you're with Sibley, then you're from Santa Fe 

01:40:35.305 --> 01:40:40.831
 Is traveling in the desert very difficult? 

01:40:40.936 --> 01:40:44.168
 Especially if you have nothing to drink 

01:40:46.253 --> 01:40:52.093
 Why are you taking the name Bill Carson now? 

01:40:54.804 --> 01:40:57.515
 A better name than the other 

01:40:57.619 --> 01:41:00.538
 It is not wise to use your name 

01:41:00.643 --> 01:41:05.022
 As you are, I bet they (they are not calling you) Angel Eyes 

01:41:05.126 --> 01:41:08.046
 Staff Sergeant Angel Eyes 

01:41:16.075 --> 01:41:19.099
 Do you like to hear music while eating, Toko? 

01:41:19.203 --> 01:41:25.251
 Music ? This is very good for digestion 

01:41:36.929 --> 01:41:39.223
 Ear 

01:41:39.327 --> 01:41:43.394
 Bill Carson (not his real name). 

01:41:47.356 --> 01:41:50.693
 These are also borrowed 

01:41:50.797 --> 01:41:54.968
 The name (Bill Carson) is written on it 

01:41:55.072 --> 01:41:59.869
 Take some, it's Bill Carson 

01:43:22.764 --> 01:43:27.143
 Is Carson alive or dead? Where did you find it? 

01:43:32.148 --> 01:43:34.442
 What did he tell you about the money? 

01:43:34.547 --> 01:43:37.153
 I do not know 

01:43:37.258 --> 01:43:39.969
 No ... I don't know what you're talking about 

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.197
 Stronger sensation 

01:44:18.653 --> 01:44:22.303
 You can consider yourself more fortunate than your friend 

01:44:22.407 --> 01:44:25.431
 Wallace will beat your friend as long as this song continues 

01:44:25.432 --> 01:44:28.976
 Many of us had sessions there 

01:44:49.622 --> 01:44:53.063
 How is digestion now? 

01:44:55.774 --> 01:45:01.092
 You better talk, I have nothing to say 

01:45:27.472 --> 01:45:30.183
 I play this violin 

01:46:13.768 --> 01:46:15.958
 I will speak ... I will speak ... 

01:46:25.447 --> 01:46:28.262
 What did he say about money? 

01:46:28.366 --> 01:46:31.807
 It is buried ... 

01:46:31.912 --> 01:46:35.352
 It is buried in a tomb 

01:46:35.457 --> 01:46:37.228
 Where .? 

01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:38.689
 Sad Hill 

01:46:38.793 --> 01:46:41.296
 In the cemetery of Sad Hill 

01:46:44.007 --> 01:46:45.987
 In which grave? 

01:46:45.988 --> 01:46:49.950
 I don't know. I don't know. I'll tell you 

01:46:51.619 --> 01:46:53.496
 Blond ... 

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:58.396
 I ask Al-Ashqar that he knows the name of the grave 

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:18.208
 The war is over for you 

01:47:20.189 --> 01:47:23.317
 I wear these clothes 

01:47:26.549 --> 01:47:28.218
 Why ? 

01:47:28.322 --> 01:47:31.346
 We will go on a trip 

01:47:31.450 --> 01:47:35.413
 Where ? Let's get $ 200,000 

01:47:35.517 --> 01:47:38.645
 I know the name of the graves now 

01:47:38.749 --> 01:47:42.294
 And you know the name of the grave 

01:48:01.376 --> 01:48:04.504
 Are you not going to treat me the same way? 

01:48:07.945 --> 01:48:09.822
 Would you speak? 

01:48:10.656 --> 01:48:12.429
 no never 

01:48:14.201 --> 01:48:16.808
 This is what I thought about 

01:48:16.912 --> 01:48:19.206
 Not because you are stronger than Toko 

01:48:19.311 --> 01:48:22.647
 But you are smart enough to know that speech will not save you 

01:48:26.401 --> 01:48:29.633
 And (Toko) is he? ... 

01:48:31.719 --> 01:48:34.846
 no not yet 

01:48:34.847 --> 01:48:37.454
 But he is in safe hands 

01:48:38.184 --> 01:48:41.729
 You changed the partner but the deal is the same 

01:48:41.730 --> 01:48:44.336
 I'm not greedy, I'll just take half 

01:48:45.691 --> 01:48:49.549
 We two this makes it easier than just one 

01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:56.535
 Yes 

01:49:15.825 --> 01:49:17.285
 Wait for it 

01:49:17.389 --> 01:49:20.101
 There is no movement 

01:49:20.205 --> 01:49:25.731
 Do not breathe 

01:49:25.835 --> 01:49:29.172
 We got it, thanks 

01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:47.524
 Corporal, I'm afraid to get lost. Where does the rebel go? 

01:49:47.628 --> 01:49:51.173
 For hell, with a rope wrapped around his neck and a prize on his head 

01:49:51.278 --> 01:49:56.387
 Yep 3000 dollars, it's a lot of head money 

01:49:56.491 --> 01:50:00.245
 I bet they didn't pay you a dime for your arm 

01:50:05.354 --> 01:50:07.127
 I told you once 

01:50:07.231 --> 01:50:12.027
 But if you fall once, you will need great help to get up again 

01:50:32.047 --> 01:50:34.237
 You are more fortunate than this 

01:50:34.341 --> 01:50:36.844
 You will get a suitable rope and then you are done 

01:50:36.948 --> 01:50:40.806
 There is no partner this time to cross for you 

01:52:21.949 --> 01:52:26.954
 If your friends stay in the dark, they will catch a cold, right? 

01:52:27.058 --> 01:52:29.457
 Or a bullet will warm them 

01:52:33.523 --> 01:52:36.860
 Did you hear that, boys? Come here 

01:52:48.121 --> 01:52:53.022
 Since we are going in the same direction, we must go together 

01:52:53.126 --> 01:52:55.629
 One Two 

01:52:55.733 --> 01:52:57.714
 Three, four 

01:52:58.235 --> 01:53:00.634
 Five, six 

01:53:01.051 --> 01:53:04.283
 Six ... that's an appropriate number 

01:53:05.534 --> 01:53:08.454
 Isn't three of them the right number? 

01:53:09.601 --> 01:53:14.085
 Yes, but I have six shots in my pistol 

01:54:16.439 --> 01:54:21.131
 Are you sure you want to put your hand on it? 

01:54:21.235 --> 01:54:25.927
 I want to pee, I was shaking on this train ten hours ago 

01:54:26.031 --> 01:54:28.847
 You smell like a pig already 

01:54:28.951 --> 01:54:31.766
 Let's not do anything worse 

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:36.146
 Come on, pee 

01:54:44.383 --> 01:54:48.033
 I can't while you look at me 

01:54:58.981 --> 01:55:00.962
 Report 

01:55:10.451 --> 01:55:14.205
 You make a noise, my friend 

01:55:34.537 --> 01:55:38.500
 You do not want to lose our friendship, no better to lose it 

01:57:22.666 --> 01:57:25.482
 Stop 

01:57:25.586 --> 01:57:28.401
 Take your places 

01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.497
 Are ready 

01:57:40.601 --> 01:57:42.061
 Aim 

01:57:42.165 --> 01:57:44.251
 Release 

01:57:59.995 --> 01:58:03.228
 Klim, take care of the horses 

02:02:18.796 --> 02:02:22.340
 I have been looking for you for 8 months 

02:02:22.341 --> 02:02:26.929
 Whenever I have a gun in my hand, I think about you 

02:02:27.033 --> 02:02:30.996
 Now I found you in the perfect position for me 

02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:36.939
 It took a long time to learn how to aim with my left hand 

02:02:50.911 --> 02:02:55.499
 When you want to hit! Hit, don't talk 

02:02:57.168 --> 02:03:00.452
 Each pistol creates its own tone 

02:03:00.453 --> 02:03:03.737
 Its perfect timing is great 

02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:23.235
 Klim, follow him. 

02:04:20.272 --> 02:04:23.294
 One minute and I will open 

02:04:23.295 --> 02:04:27.049
 Give me a moment to put on my clothes and I will open for you 

02:04:47.278 --> 02:04:50.823
 Put on your underpants and take off your gun 

02:04:59.165 --> 02:05:01.040
 You are 

02:05:01.041 --> 02:05:05.734
 You blond, how the hell did you get out of that pigyard? 

02:05:07.298 --> 02:05:11.677
 In my own way, I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes 

02:05:12.198 --> 02:05:15.639
 I told him, traitor, I told him 

02:05:16.265 --> 02:05:20.957
 No, I didn't tell him if I did, I wouldn't be here now 

02:05:22.313 --> 02:05:24.920
 you are me... 

02:05:25.024 --> 02:05:27.839
 Then you only know half the secret 

02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.930
 Oh blond 

02:05:35.034 --> 02:05:39.413
 I am happy that you are working with me and we are together again 

02:05:39.414 --> 02:05:43.063
 I will get dressed, I will kill him and I will return 

02:05:43.167 --> 02:05:47.129
 Listen ! I forgot a note 

02:05:47.234 --> 02:05:52.030
 It is not alone there are five of them 

02:05:52.134 --> 02:05:55.471
 Five? Yeah, five of them? 

02:05:57.765 --> 02:06:01.519
 That’s why you came to me, Toko 

02:06:03.604 --> 02:06:06.315
 I don't care, I will kill them all 

02:06:17.993 --> 02:06:21.122
 They shot him at close range 

02:06:39.682 --> 02:06:44.583
 Well look from there the other one will support him 

02:06:46.564 --> 02:06:50.213
 They will come looking for us 

02:06:50.317 --> 02:06:52.507
 Watch them 

02:06:52.611 --> 02:06:55.635
 They are two 

02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:57.929
 I want this blond alive 

02:07:06.792 --> 02:07:10.442
 You go back there, let's go 

02:07:44.121 --> 02:07:46.519
 Are you going to die alone 

02:10:03.219 --> 02:10:06.347
 Angel Eyes to me 

02:10:06.348 --> 02:10:08.015
 OK 

02:10:47.325 --> 02:10:52.122
 See you soon, A. 

02:10:52.226 --> 02:10:54.728
 Foolish.. 

02:10:54.833 --> 02:10:57.127
 it's yours 

02:11:21.422 --> 02:11:24.341
 Oh calm and peace, O owner 

02:11:24.446 --> 02:11:28.095
 Like graves, for example 

02:11:28.199 --> 02:11:31.119
 There should be a bridge to cross the river 

02:11:31.223 --> 02:11:36.854
 It is better to wait until night. Trust me, blond 

02:11:36.855 --> 02:11:39.669
 I have a strong sense of wherever I go 

02:11:39.774 --> 02:11:43.736
 Toko will take you away ... I'll take you from the ways 

02:11:48.845 --> 02:11:51.869
 Tell the commander. - Yes, sir 

02:11:51.973 --> 02:11:55.310
 Come on now, follow me 

02:12:40.981 --> 02:12:44.526
 We found them near the border, sir 

02:12:57.977 --> 02:13:00.271
 Where did you come from? 

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:01.730
 Illinois 

02:13:04.129 --> 02:13:06.006
 And you ? 

02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:07.987
 I am with him 

02:13:13.930 --> 02:13:17.267
 What are your justifications for being here? 

02:13:17.371 --> 02:13:20.395
 We want to volunteer, General 

02:13:22.897 --> 02:13:25.191
 It is better to learn to distinguish between ranks 

02:13:25.296 --> 02:13:27.381
 I'm a captain 

02:13:28.737 --> 02:13:31.552
 Get out the hell 

02:13:31.656 --> 02:13:34.680
 You can be in hell today, go write your will 

02:13:34.681 --> 02:13:36.766
 Yes . Sir 

02:13:41.562 --> 02:13:43.856
 If you want to volunteer 

02:13:44.794 --> 02:13:48.548
 You should pass the test to confirm this 

02:13:56.473 --> 02:13:58.975
 Well show me 

02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:20.038
 You are... 

02:14:21.811 --> 02:14:26.190
 You are acceptable, at least you will be a colonel 

02:14:26.294 --> 02:14:29.109
 Really? Sure 

02:14:29.110 --> 02:14:31.299
 As they say in the brochure 

02:14:31.404 --> 02:14:36.721
 You must be qualified to be an expert in the use of weapons 

02:14:36.826 --> 02:14:41.935
 This is the most effective weapon in war 

02:14:43.707 --> 02:14:47.357
 The fighting spirit in the bottle 

02:14:48.504 --> 02:14:50.485
 The volunteers 

02:14:52.049 --> 02:14:56.429
 Want to volunteer? so let's go 

02:14:56.533 --> 02:14:59.661
 Come on gentlemen ... come on 

02:15:01.121 --> 02:15:04.562
 The beating did not start after you came in time 

02:15:13.112 --> 02:15:14.572
 Verse 

02:15:20.307 --> 02:15:23.226
 Who has the strongest alcohol to make the soldiers drunk? 

02:15:23.330 --> 02:15:27.293
 And send them to where they are slaughtered will be the winner 

02:15:27.397 --> 02:15:33.862
 We and the other side of the river have one thing in common 

02:15:33.966 --> 02:15:36.260
 We all smoke from alcohol. 

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:46.791
 You say what his name is? 

02:15:46.896 --> 02:15:48.147
 Aa ... 

02:15:48.981 --> 02:15:51.171
 And you? 

02:15:51.901 --> 02:15:53.048
 Aa ... 

02:15:53.152 --> 02:15:55.133
 Aa ... no 

02:16:00.138 --> 02:16:02.849
 Names do not matter 

02:16:02.953 --> 02:16:08.480
 Because you can join soon, you will be champions of the Branston Bridge 

02:16:08.584 --> 02:16:10.878
 We have two fighting a day 

02:16:10.982 --> 02:16:13.589
 Two fighting a day, for sure 

02:16:13.693 --> 02:16:18.907
 The damned Rip decided that this bridge is the key to the whole area 

02:16:19.011 --> 02:16:22.035
 Useless bridge 

02:16:22.139 --> 02:16:25.476
 A small spot on the main maps 

02:16:26.519 --> 02:16:31.941
 And the leadership announced that this ridiculous spot must be seized 

02:16:32.983 --> 02:16:35.173
 Even if we all killed 

02:16:35.277 --> 02:16:40.908
 On the other side, the switch has become rusty and has just become a stain on the wall 

02:16:40.909 --> 02:16:45.703
 And that's not all the sides want the bridge intact 

02:16:45.704 --> 02:16:51.022
 The south wants him and we too 

02:16:52.795 --> 02:16:57.174
 All of you will turn to dust, but one thing is certain, boys 

02:16:57.279 --> 02:17:01.658
 (Pranston Bridge) will remain unbreakable 

02:17:01.762 --> 02:17:06.976
 Is this bad for talking to volunteers? 

02:17:06.977 --> 02:17:10.312
 I did worse 

02:17:13.441 --> 02:17:17.924
 I did it, it blew it up 

02:17:18.028 --> 02:17:21.261
 Here, I completely destroyed it 

02:17:22.199 --> 02:17:27.413
 The military court will be upset just for the dream of detonating it. A major crime 

02:17:27.517 --> 02:17:33.148
 ... even thinking about destroying this bridge just 

02:17:34.608 --> 02:17:36.902
 Why don't we really blow it up, Captain 

02:17:38.570 --> 02:17:41.907
 Yes, sir, it's nothing. Let's turn it into hell 

02:17:45.347 --> 02:17:48.476
 I dreamed of this 

02:17:50.978 --> 02:17:54.419
 You made a plan 

02:17:54.523 --> 02:17:56.504
 I am sure 

02:17:57.443 --> 02:18:00.675
 The right time is after the attack 

02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:04.638
 When they are ready to transport the wounded 

02:18:04.742 --> 02:18:09.747
 If I can do it, I will save thousands of men 

02:18:14.752 --> 02:18:17.880
 But I lack courage 

02:18:23.094 --> 02:18:26.326
 They are starting the daily massacre now 

02:18:26.430 --> 02:18:29.767
 All groups are waiting for your orders, sir 

02:18:29.871 --> 02:18:32.582
 I will be here 

02:18:45.095 --> 02:18:47.283
 Let's go 

02:18:47.284 --> 02:18:49.266
 Well guys 

02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:52.602
 Come on, enjoy the play 

02:19:22.945 --> 02:19:25.343
 Groups, report 

02:19:25.448 --> 02:19:28.263
 Group B prepare 

02:19:28.367 --> 02:19:31.182
 Group C get ready 

02:19:31.287 --> 02:19:34.311
 Community "D" braced 

02:19:39.211 --> 02:19:42.965
 Groups, forward 

02:20:03.924 --> 02:20:07.886
 It seems that the captain wants a bullet in his bravery 

02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:10.076
 Yes 

02:21:02.315 --> 02:21:06.695
 I have never seen scattered men like this 

02:21:26.298 --> 02:21:30.677
 I have a feeling that it will be a long battle 

02:21:34.014 --> 02:21:36.203
 blonde 

02:21:36.308 --> 02:21:38.914
 Money on the other side of the river 

02:21:39.019 --> 02:21:41.938
 Where ? 

02:21:44.232 --> 02:21:48.194
 I said on the other side, and that is enough 

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:52.782
 But while these are here, we will not be able to cross 

02:21:52.887 --> 02:21:57.996
 What would happen if someone blew this bridge? 

02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:04.148
 These goons go elsewhere to fight 

02:22:04.149 --> 02:22:06.233
 Probably 

02:22:43.458 --> 02:22:47.420
 Hurry up doctor, Captain is injured 

02:22:48.776 --> 02:22:51.591
 Stretcher quickly 

02:22:52.738 --> 02:22:55.553
 take it easy 

02:23:05.459 --> 02:23:08.170
 Prepare things 

02:23:27.982 --> 02:23:30.901
 A little of this will help 

02:23:36.428 --> 02:23:38.930
 Take this, captain 

02:23:39.034 --> 02:23:41.016
 He kept the eyes open 

02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:33.464
 What do you do ? No ... leave me alone 

02:26:11.896 --> 02:26:15.962
 Blond, you realize that our lives are in danger? 

02:26:16.484 --> 02:26:22.323
 If I die I will not get that beautiful money 

02:26:22.324 --> 02:26:24.200
 Yes, Toko 

02:26:25.138 --> 02:26:27.432
 Sure it would be unfortunate 

02:26:57.358 --> 02:26:58.505
 Duc ... 

02:27:00.799 --> 02:27:05.595
 Doctor ... make me live for a short time 

02:27:05.699 --> 02:27:08.619
 I am expecting good news 

02:27:58.669 --> 02:28:01.693
 Why do not we tell each other the secret that we have? 

02:28:01.797 --> 02:28:04.300
 why not ? 

02:28:05.342 --> 02:28:07.428
 You Start 

02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:13.997
 I don't think it's better 

02:28:14.101 --> 02:28:16.499
 You start 

02:28:19.628 --> 02:28:22.339
 OK 

02:28:23.173 --> 02:28:27.761
 The name of the graves is 

02:28:43.714 --> 02:28:45.904
 Sad Hill, now it's your turn. 

02:28:54.141 --> 02:28:56.957
 The name on the grave is 

02:29:00.397 --> 02:29:02.482
 Arch Stanton 

02:29:02.483 --> 02:29:06.028
 Arch Stanton 

02:29:06.132 --> 02:29:08.322
 are you sure ? 

02:29:08.426 --> 02:29:10.616
 Sure sure 

02:40:58.929 --> 02:41:02.474
 It will be easier to use this 

02:41:41.575 --> 02:41:43.765
 Two burrows faster than one 

02:41:44.391 --> 02:41:46.476
 I dig 

02:41:48.457 --> 02:41:50.126
 You do not dig 

02:42:02.638 --> 02:42:07.017
 If you kill me, you will not see a single penny of this money 

02:42:07.852 --> 02:42:09.207
 Why ? 

02:42:12.127 --> 02:42:14.734
 I will tell you why? 

02:42:14.838 --> 02:42:17.340
 Because nothing here 

02:42:25.473 --> 02:42:28.706
 You think I trust you 

02:42:32.042 --> 02:42:35.692
 Two hundred thousand dollars, a large amount 

02:42:35.796 --> 02:42:38.924
 We have to win it 

02:42:41.531 --> 02:42:43.825
 How ? 

02:42:53.731 --> 02:42:56.650
 I will write the name on the back of this stone 

02:43:00.404 --> 02:43:02.490
 The gun? 

02:49:08.376 --> 02:49:12.547
 Despicable! You wanted me to kill when did you empty it? 

02:49:14.528 --> 02:49:16.821
 Last night 

02:49:16.822 --> 02:49:21.619
 You see, there are two kinds of people in this world, my friend 

02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:26.311
 Those who are with Muammar’s gun and those who dig 

02:49:26.415 --> 02:49:28.396
 You dig 

02:49:28.501 --> 02:49:30.586
 Where ? 

02:49:40.387 --> 02:49:42.786
 Here 

02:49:43.724 --> 02:49:45.600
 It has no name 

02:49:45.601 --> 02:49:48.521
 It has no name 

02:49:48.625 --> 02:49:51.336
 There is no name here either 

02:49:52.691 --> 02:49:55.611
 This is what Bill Carson told me 

02:49:55.715 --> 02:50:00.512
 There is an unknown grave on it, right next to Archton 

02:50:07.289 --> 02:50:09.792
 Come on 

02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:10.373
 It's money! All of us are blond 

02:51:26.327 --> 02:51:31.436
 You are kidding, you will not kidding me this way 

02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:34.877
 It's no joke, it's a rope, Toko 

02:51:34.981 --> 02:51:38.318
 I want you to stand there and put your head in this rope 

02:52:45.573 --> 02:52:49.535
 Well now ... like the old days 

02:52:54.123 --> 02:52:56.834
 Four for you 

02:52:58.085 --> 02:53:01.213
 And four ... 

02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:04.863
 And four for me 

02:53:30.931 --> 02:53:32.286
 Ash ... 

02:53:32.390 --> 02:53:33.746
 Ash ... 

02:53:42.922 --> 02:53:45.216
 blonde ... 

02:53:46.467 --> 02:53:49.178
 Sorry, Toko 

02:53:52.202 --> 02:53:53.557
 blonde 

02:54:02.733 --> 02:54:05.027
 blonde 

02:54:12.952 --> 02:54:15.037
 blonde 

02:54:24.839 --> 02:54:25.881
 blonde 

02:54:36.517 --> 02:54:38.394
 blonde 

02:54:53.617 --> 02:54:56.328
 blonde 

02:55:17.495 --> 02:55:20.311
 You filthy son of a bitch! 

02:55:22.709 --> 02:55:25.107
 blonde 

02:56:24.333 --> 02:56:27.461
 blonde 

02:56:28.295 --> 02:56:31.632
 Do you know what you are? 

02:56:34.864 --> 02:56:36.741
 .... you are just a filthy son
